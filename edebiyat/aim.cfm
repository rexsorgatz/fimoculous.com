				<br>
				The word <em>Edebiyât</em> means "literature" in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Urdu (shall we go on?).  We use the Turkish spelling which after all requires no transcription, since it's already in the Latin alphabet.  
				<br><br>
				The journal began in 1974 when Roger Allen (University of Pennsylvania), Walter Andrews (University of Washington) and William Hanaway (University of Pennsylvania) had the inspiration to begin a journal whose dialogue would cross boundaries in two ways.  First, it went beyond a disciplinary habit that emerged whenever specialists dealt with Middle Eastern literature: an insistence on philology and history, a determination to study each tradition as if they were rare insects.  We are all thankful to the philological tradition, which indeed is necessary to us, but there is a dialogue available which extends into the disciplines of literary criticism.  Second, <em>Edebiyât</em> insisted on combining studies of all the Middle Eastern languages in one forum.  (Allen is an Arabist, Andrews a Turkologist and Hanaway a specialist in Persian.).  Professor Hanaway was the general editor, and those of us who read the journal regularly felt it represented a whole new direction in the field, perhaps the outline of a new field altogether.
