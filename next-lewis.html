	"Children enjoy one big advantage over adults: they haven't decided who they are.",
	"'If it wasn't for people manipulating the stock market, there wouldn't be a stock market at all' -- Jonathan Lebed",
	"I had been surprised to learn it was legal for, say, an author to write phony glowing reviews of his latest book on Amazon.com but illegal to plug a stock on Yahoo Financial message boards just because he happened to own it.",
	"What is the wide society's instinctive attitude toward knowledge? Are we willing to look for it wherever it might be found, or only from people who are suposed to possess it?",
	"The passages of time allows older people to remember who they were as they would like to have been. Young people do not enjoy access to that particular escape route from their selves -- their pasts are still unpleasantly present -- and so they tend to turn the other way and imagine themselves into some future adult world. The sentiment that powers their fantasies goes by different names -- hope, ambition, idealism -- but at bottom it is nostalia. Nostalgia for the future. These days nostaliga for the future is a lot more fashionable than the traditional kind. And the Internet has made it possible to act on the fantasy in whole new ways.",
	"The Internet had arrived at an embarrassing moment for the law. The knowledge gap between lawyers and non-lawyers had been shrinking for some time, and the Internet was closing it further.",
	"Pere-to-peer computing made the Internet what it wanted to be, and what it was originally designed to be: an exchange of equals or, at any rate, an exchange among people on the same level.",
	"In a few short years, it [the Internet] pretty much gutted the principles of corporate socialism -- jobs for life, employee and customer loyalty, all for one and one for all -- and replaced them with something more raw. It did this in the name of efficiency; just as, in the name of efficiency, it had co-opted the socialistic impulses that could be put to use.",
	"What a man does with his remote control may not be a perfect reflection of the contents of his character, but it is a lot more perfect than judging him solely by his simple surface traits.",
	"One of the reasons people used to watch TV in the 1950s and '60s was for the shared experience. The metaphor for the country was the melting pot: people wanted to be the same. People read <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> mainly because other people read <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i>. Now the metaphor is the quilt."
