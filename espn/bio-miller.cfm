		<p>James Andrew Miller served as Special Assistant and Chief Speechwriter to Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, Jr.  His first book, "Running in Place: Inside the Senate," a well-reviewed bestseller (Simon and Schuster, 1986), was based partly on his experiences in the Majority Leader's office.</p>
		<p>He began his television career as a producer at CBS News in 1984, and in 1988 became Vice-President of the television division at Norman Lear's ACT III Communications. Miller also served as executive producer for several Lear television series and numerous others, including Dick Wolf's "D.C." In film, Miller has written or rewritten screenplays for Sony, Warner Bros., Universal, Disney, Fox, New Line, Paramount and HBO.</p>
		<p>In 1999, Miller became Executive Vice-President for USA Cable, where he oversaw the scripted series, TV-movie and reality divisions. As head of original programming, one of Miller's first acquisitions was the pilot script for the acclaimed series "Monk," still a mainstay of the USA schedule. Miller also oversaw the development of a reality series with Mark Burnett and the production of more than a dozen movies for television.</p>
		<p>In 2003, Miller was hired by CNN and served as the first Senior Executive Producer for both the breakthrough series "Anderson Cooper 360" and for "Paula Zahn Now." Miller also co-authored "Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live" (with Tom Shales of The Washington Post, Little, Brown, 2002), which spent 15 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and was chosen by Fortune Magazine as one of the top 75 books of all time to deal with workplace issues. Miller began his writing career at The Washington Post as a member of its TV team.</p>
		<p>Miller received his undergraduate degree in Economics and Political Science with honors from Occidental College in Los Angeles, an M. Litt. with honors from Oxford University, and an MBA with honors from Harvard University.
