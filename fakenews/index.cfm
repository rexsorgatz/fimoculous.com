<div class="title">F For Fake</div>
<p>What would it take to build an <strong>Academy of Fake News</strong>? Perhaps a <strong>Fake News Hall of Fame</strong> would suffice. And who would our inductees be?</p>

<p>The print world would supply the first round of usual suspects -- <em>The Onion</em>, <em>Spy</em>, and maybe <em>Might</em>. And then television would be recognized -- <em>The Daily Show</em> would arrive in the second round; <em>SNL</em>'s "Weekend Update" would get some sort of lifetime achievement award. Our mythical academy would confront its first crisis when Michael Moore suggests that films (particularly those <em>controversy du jour</em> quasi-autobiographical documentaries) deserve notation in our hallowed corridors. Overnight, our Hall of Fame would be derided as a sell-out when  <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> is chosen as the first film to be inducted. Angry traditionalists would argue that the fake canon started with Orson Welles' <em>F for Fake</em>.</p>

<p>All of that fake preamble is a setup to point out that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007M2234/"><em>F For Fake</em></a> is being released on DVD next month. Postmodern before there was such a thing, <em>Fake</em> is a rocket ride though great art forgeries, Howard Hughes biographies, and fact versus fiction conundrums. Long overdue to DVD, this fake classic is being released by Criterion on April 26.</p>

<br>
<div class="title">Insert <em>Onion</em> Headline Here</div>
<p>Since fake news has become its own legitimate segment of the media industry (<em>because I said so, that's why</em>), <em>The Onion</em> should consider self-parody. A fake story of a fake news organization would be perfect. Borrow liberally from the <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2005/04/12/Floridian/Peeling_the_Onion.shtml" target="_blank">new <em>Onion</em> profile</a> in the <em>SP Times</em>.</p>

<div class="title">April Fools</div>
<p>Tomorrow is a holy day for this site. We'll try to catalogue all the fake news pouring in, but let's start off by honoring a classic, <a href="http://bobsfridge.com/poyntless05.htm" target="_blank">Poyntless</a>, a yearly <strong>Romenesko parody</strong>.</p>

<br>
<div class="title">False Tabloids</div>
<p>Britney Spears <a href="http://britneyspears.com/letters-item.php?item=050330" target="_blank">writes in her journal</a> today: "I bet you are asking yourself: 'Who? Who, me? Am I a false tabloid? Well, I don't know.'" She then disses <em>Us Weekly</em>, <em>In Touch</em>, and <em>Star</em>. But she loves <em>People</em>!</p>

<br>
<div class="title">Being Adam Nagourney</div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.adamnagourney.com/" target="_blank">fake Adam Nagourney blog</a> hasn't been updated in over a week, which is very upsetting to those of us closely following fake media personalities. You think it's possible that the real Nagourney would be upset that his fake personality is being portrayed as lazy?</p>

<div class="title">Terry Schiavo Obit On CBSNews.com</div>
<p><a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2005/03/30/Tampabay/Schiavo_obituary_plac.shtml">SPTimes.com</a> is reporting that <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/">CBSNews.com</a> accidentally placed an obit for <strong>Terry Schiavo</strong> on its site this morning.</p>

<div class="title">FCC Called To The Stand</div>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,151871,00.html">FoxNews.com story</a>, the organization <a href="http://www.freepress.net/action/fakenews">Free Press</a> has gathered 40,000 signatures on a petition asking the FCC, Congress, and broadcasters to stop fake news.</p>

<div class="title">Michael Jackson Cinema Verite</div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.eonline.com/News/Specials/Jackson/index.html" target="_blank">Michael Jackson trial re-enactmennts on E!</a> are undeniably the craziest thing to ever appear on television. Imagine if 20 years ago someone had written a novel (let's imagine it's Brett Easton Ellis -- with a cover designed by Jeff Koons) that told the story about <strong>Michael Jackson</strong> being arrested for child molestation. AND that an entertainment cable network would do video re-enactments of the trial every night. The <em>NYTBR</em> review of this hypothetical book would call it 'outlandish'.</p>

<div class="title">Your Weekly Dose Of <em>The Onion</em></div>
<p>It's time again for our weekly feature <strong>Best <em>Onion</em> Headline</strong>. And this week's winner is: <a href="http://theonion.com/news/index.php?issue=4113">"America Still Searching For Funniest Home Video"</a>.</p>

<div class="title">Doubts Raised On Schiavo Memo</div>
<p>The only thing more surreal than imagining another fake memo scandal would be imagining one that involves <strong>Terry Schiavo</strong>. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11250-2005Mar29.html" target="_blank">Howard Kurtz is on the case</a>, which involves the return of Powerline scandal-monger John Hinderaker and, of course, copious livid bloggers.</p>

<div class="title"><em>B&C</em> On The Art Of Manufactured News</div>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA513090.html?display=Feature&referral=SUPP">profile</a> of PR firms that create fake newscasts, <em>Broadcasting and Cable</em> gives us another word for fake news: "<strong>branded journalism</strong>." You gotta hand it to them -- that sounds so much more user-friendly. Someone should really make a manual for all these terms.</p>

<div class="title">No <em>Daily Show</em> Recaps</div>
<p>What a stupid week to launch this blog -- the <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart">Daily Show</a> is in re-runs all week. Tune in next week for daily recaps.</p>

<div class="title">Fake Term Paper</div>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.aweekofkindness.com/blog/archives/2005/03/laura_k_pahl_is.html" target="_blank">funny story</a> about a blogger who was solicited via AIM to write a term paper on Hinduism for a college student. There's a debate in the comments about whether he did the right thing.</p>

<br>
<div class="title">Scandal de Jour</div>
<p>In America, the scandalous anonymous blogger controversy of 2004 was <a href="http://washingtoniennearchive.blogspot.com/">Washingtonienne</a>, a D.C. diarist who spoke freely about her salacious sexual escapades with various Capital Hill staffers. (The ordeal landed the Wonkette-outed author, <strong>Jessica Cutler</strong>, a book deal and a <em>Playboy</em> spread.) Meanwhile, Britain had their own pseudonymous call-girl blogger <a href="http://belledejour-uk.blogspot.com/">Belle de Jour</a>, who never seemed to catch on in America, but who had the London press (particularly the tabloids) going ga-ga.</p>
<p>None of this qualified as potential "fake news" until this week when <em>The Times</em> of London effectively <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1543466,00.html">outed writer <strong>Lisa Hilton</strong> as the Belle in question</a>. A British author based in America, Hilton also writes regularly for <em>The Guardian</em>, including a piece entitled <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/top10s/top10/0,6109,852351,00.html">"Lisa Hilton's top 10 scandalous French novels."</a></p>
<p>In the lede the story, <em>The Times</em> unironically calls this "one of the literary world's most carefully guarded secrets." It doesn't help the paper's case that it has <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1042250,00.html">already outed</a> other people as the author of blog. But if Belle is Hilton, it would seem that some of the sexual encounters described on Belle de Jour were fiction. As Drudge says, "Developing..."</p>

<p><em>The America Spectator</em> <a href="http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=7720" target="_blank">has named</a> Jon Stewart's <em>America</em> -- a fake history book -- the worst book of 2004.</p>
