I stumbled across the VLOG that Rocketboom did on you last week. I worked with you at IBS a few years ago, and was like: ""Wow! Rex! Cool!"" Congratulations on the celeb status.","05/27/05 10:23:32",0,

132,819,"platocave",,"Pudie, I'd agree that expecting all the answers would be a stretch since it seems like the Lost writers are making some of this up as they go along, but they really didn't conclusively answer much of anything in that finale - it was akin to a regular one-hour Lost (and not even a particularly good one-hour Lost) stretched to two hours and masqerading as a finale.  What new characterization was developed?  They just relied on the info from previous actually good 1-hour eps written by David Fury - the ones on Locke and Hurley.  Nothing much happened that we didn't already know.  Hatch - nothing.  Claire's baby - ditto.  The only thing that changed was the situation of the people on the raft, but that's not enough to justify two hours.  They could have at least developed an Arzt flashback so that we could feel emotionally for him before he got blown up.  

And just to go back to my Veronica Mars showcrush, the final two episodes of that season provided all the answers its rabid fans needed but also ended by providing some small open-ended questions that will keep fans anxious for the new season to begin.  Lost's writers should honestly take notes. ","05/27/05 11:08:21",0,
133,819,"dynagrrl",,"Well, I loved the Lost finale... I think it was a good amount of tension, lots of numbers everywhere, you got to see lots of people getting to the plane rounding out the idea of them being real people getting on a real plane home... I don't know, too many answers would have spoiled the mystery.  Not to mention the fact that if they had answered the questions, next season would have been an entirely different show. I really enjoyed the finale.  On a different note, Veronica Mars starts in Toronto on MONDAY NIGHT!  Yeah!  Finally, I can see what all the hubbub is!","05/27/05 14:06:45",0,

We did see some of the ""monster"".  The black mist after they got Locke out of the whole.  We did see inside the hatch.  If you thought we would see EVERYTHING in the hatch you are very sadly mistaken.  I think it was pretty obvious that wouldnt happen.  We saw the others , they took Walt.  So quite a lot was at least adressed , if not answerd.  And like I said before , the mystery goes through all the seasons and we wont have all the naswers untill the show is over and done.

On a seperate note.  The Alais cliffhanger.  God damn.  Totally out of nowhere.","05/27/05 16:14:23",0,
138,819,"platocave",,"Can we agree to disagree then, Pudie?  I didn't think we would see EVERYTHING in the hatch because, as I wrote above, I don't think that Lost is that type of show - the writers are making some of this up as they go along, as opposed to VM's writers, who knew where they were going from the beginning and went there, spectacularly.  But the hatch situation did not change at all imo - they still don't know who, what, when, where, why, and are no closer in finding the answers to the hatch than the week before because the ladder is shown broken and leading to a seemingly bottomless abyss.  It was like breaking into a Brinks security van only to find another vault inside.  That kind of fakeout is serviceable as a middle-of-an-episode confounder but not generally for the end of an episode and especially not for an end of a season.  I just think that the Lost finale moved slower than it had to.  YMMV.  Still a good season overall, but you had better be right that we will have most of the answers after the entire show is over and done because I'm not alone in having a bad taste in my mouth after the season 1 finale.","05/27/05 20:09:24",0,
139,819,"Pudie",," Can we agree to disagree then, Pudie?

-Sure. One last thing though.  The writers have said they have the sotry planned out through the next few seasons.  So they arent making it up as they go along.

I regards to your $0.08/day google adsense income, that low amount may be in part because many people read your blog on an RSS reader, so cannot see the ads.  i.e. I noticed about 150 people on Bloglines alone.

To generate some income, I don't think anyone would have a huge problem if you made 'sincere' recommendations for items you could earn affiliate money from...

i.e. if you read a fantastic book related to one of your posts, put an Amazon aff. link at the bottom of that post.  If you genuinely recommend a product, then most people shouldn't have a problem with you doing that efery once in a while. (imo)

Regards and good luck (p.s. and you could make your Google adssense ads have the same border color as the background (blue) and test if it increases your CTR). :)

RELAX.  You don't live in New York--you only obsess over it.  You're reading the Fashion & Style section of the Times, so if you're not taking EVERYTHING you read with a grain of salt, you're only going to torture yourself.  Why doesn't the Star Tribune have a Fashion section?  Probably because it's a stupid idea to have one in the first place.  Keep in mind that you're reading the newspaper of locals who don't have backyards (yes, I read the article, too) and have few places to have a party outside of their blazing hot apartments.  I know you're savvy; I read your blog all the time.  I want to encourage you to move out of the Twin Cities and live here so you can discuss our city with a little research behind your statements.  

Your other option is do your best to relate to a typical new yorker--one who doesn't make loads of money, lives in a very small place, and has little outlet for ""fun-without-crowds.""  That person may find a rooftop slightly interesting and peaceful.  Granted, I don't relate to the models and actors that were interviewed for Julia Chaplin's article either.  And I definitely think it's a manipulative way to entice readers.  Most of the people interviewed made me want to barf, but remember, it's the FASHION & STYLE section.  Don't give it too much clout.  This is your biggest mistake.

New Yorkers like their roofs because they are a haven away from crowds.  Plain and simple.  You get this more often than you even realize.

One, because yes New York does gobble everyone up (I put off moving here for years because of that factor). Two, you don't have to live here to see how absolutely obsessed New Yorkers are with themselves and every bloody little facet of this (admittedly fascinating) city, a tunnel vision which I think is part of what Rex reacts negatively to in things like breathlessly rapturous writings on roof-top parties.

I'm a former MidWesterner who has lived in New York a lot longer than you (brooklyn, too) and I can't believe that I have to defend New Yorkers to you.  If this is how you feel about your neighbors generally, then what is the draw you feel to live here.
<br>
Rex:                Like I said, I know you're savvy and I know you've visited nyc numerous times.  You're missing the point regarding rooftop parties.  Yes, that one that was featured in the Times ""Style"" section was ludicrous, but can you tell me that you've never been to a fun rooftop party in nyc or brooklyn?  I wrote my comment above to defend the New York City Rooftop Party.  Also, I didn't say you hated the city--let's be civil here...  You wouldn't be reading Gawker everyday if you didn't at least find the city tempting or interesting.  It's obvious to me that you like the city quite a bit.  By the way, enjoy the Siren Festival.

Just saying that if I do have a criticism (as one has criticisms of people just about anywhere), it is that New Yorkers tend to limit their worldview to the five boroughs and the five boroughs alone. I'm hardly alone in thinking this. It's a perhaps inevitable side effect of living in the world's greatest city -- after awhile, people here tend to look inward as opposed to outward. Again, dearly love the place and the people especially, but if they have a fault (as indeed everyone does) in my mind it's a tendency to forget that there's a whole other world out there.

Not only is Rex using the word hipster (see anonymous comment above this one), he's living the life of the Imagined Hipster.  Goes to New York, hobnobs with a bunch wannabe musicians (aka: rock writers) and downs loads of drinks.
<br>
I think Rex would tell you that he's using the word ""hipster"" in a funny, mocking sort of way, but if you take a look <a href=""http://www.gawker.com/news/party-crash/team-party-crash-chuck-klostermans-killing-yourself-to-live-book-party-113289.php"">at this</a>, you might start to wonder why he uses such a word.

We left there in '93, and to tell you the truth, it was the worst place I ever had the misfortune to be forced to live (husband was stationed at GFAFB in the ATC tower).  We were sneeringly referred to as ""basers"" and I was denied employment that had previously been offered, but then revoked after it was discovered I was ""military.""  People were very unfriendly to us in the neighborhood in which we bought a house (1425 Cottonwood, if you remember where that is)we only lived there for a year. We'd smile and wave, and they'd look at us with no response and go back in their houses. We had to buy a small house because there was nothing available on base and no rental property available anywhere in a halfway decent neighborhood. We hated it there, but regardless of that, I felt very badly about the fire and all the displaced people like yourself. It's funny though, GFAFB came through for the town, even though the town took every opportunity to disassociate itself from the base previous to that.  The medical providers in town wouldn't even take CHAMPUS (the military insurance) for dependents of active duty military.  And in a city of only 50,000, there isn't a lot of choice as to what doctors you can see.  I also felt very badly for the young couple starting out who bought our house that was listed for all of a day and a half before someone snapped it up (very little mid-priced housing in that city).  Evidently the homes on the three or four blocks behind Cottonwood to the river were all demolished.  Cottonwood survived, but had basement flooding. I still believe that if you were to give the country an enema, Grand Forks is where you should stick the nozzle... Thanks!","09/01/05 11:31:18",0,

I am truly sorry you had such a rotten experience here in Grand Forks. I am a N.D. native and have lived in GF since 1987. I have had a very positive experience with people from the GFAB. A coworker whose husband was stationed here until just this summer enjoyed her stay here and thought we all were very friendly and generous. She even misses the place even though they ended up stationed in a nice community in Florida. I am sure she will change her mind when December rolls around though. I actually live in the 1500 block of a street on the river side of Cottonwood so not all the homes were demolished. But there is about a two block blank space to the north of us. We moved there after the flood and while it is true we don't know all our neighbors the ones we have become acquainted with are very friendly. It's true some people up here may be a bit stand offish until they get to know you. Some people see too much familiarity when you first meet someone as ""phony"" and don't like it. An example, when Walmart first came to town, people up here did not really feel comfortable with a person standing inside the door waiting to greet you like you were their best friend even though they didn't know you from Adam. It's a different culture although some would say the North Dakota Culture is an oxymoron and I would have to agree to a certain extent. But to not respond to a wave and a smile from a neighbor is just plain rude and inescusable in my book and I feel badly that you were treated that way. I have heard a lot of Base Personnel have bad memories of here and a lot that have good memories. I guess everyone's experience is different and although I am sorry you had a bad one, I have enjoyed living here where we can raise our family in a relatively safe and quiet atmosphere. You weren't happy here and that's okay. Everyone is different. I just hope you have found a place where you are truly happy. Take care and best to you.

357,789,"G.Schill",,"North Dakota- you either love it or hate it; there isn't any ""middle ground"" (except for everywhere you look) on the subject!  I am a Bismarck native and had close relatives affected by the Grandforks flood.  Imagine 500,000 and counting people displaced compared to 50,000. 

I know it will take the spirit of hard working Americans to rebuild and restore New Orleans and North Dakotans are some of the hardest workers and caring people out there.  It seems we are so far from the tragedy and so close in our hearts and minds. 

I for one feel ND is a great place to raise children, but I have heard the term ""baser"" and people sometimes think they arent as viable to a community because they know they are planning to leave the base when it comes time. I don't think that is so much the case anymore.  Bismarck is a Boomin'- six large scale businesses are making their debut within the next year and there are going to be some major job opportunities in almost every field.  I am a 28 year old graduate from U of Mary the only college in the Biz area that offered a BA and now recently Bismarck State College is choosing to offer BA degrees.  

Send the displaced victims, families, and their children here for the education safety, and neighborly love they and many others have never imagined!  I have room for a family of three people or will care for up to two displaced children for as long as it takes them to rebuild their lives.  I think ND residents are probably lucky to have the fast easy access to some of the aid and programs available for temporary assistance- it isn't the nightmare that it is in larger cities.  

I was at one time a single mother before going to back to school, marrying again, having a second child and becoming a teacher.  I think the victims of Katrina and their families could easily rebuild their lives at least temporarily in little state and nooks around the country instead of living in hotels and overcrowded centers.  This is a just a suggestion give people a round trip ticket to wherever they choose on to these thousands of available homes and let them normalize their lives and get the children into school- get them to doctors and counselors in a place like ND where really, there much so much non-emergent care happening.  Sometimes it is bleakly boring but we roll cars downhill for fun and tie a chain to the sheriffs axel and around a tree as we speed by, so it's not all that bad!  It is so comical that you mention the Alice Cooper song for graduation.  I live next to and work at a small town school in Wing it is a k-12 school which only has 80 some students.   Schools Out for summer is still the favorite it seems.  

It is sad to so sad to say and I am usually not a big Whitehouse basher, but after the slow reaction to the disaster relief I surely hope our government taking into account the longevity of the situation.   They should be taking necessary initiative needed to be seriously planning the next stages of placement for these thousands and thousands of people.  They dont have to suffer living with these cramped and unrealistic living situations for the period of time it will take to reestablish the buildings, networks, and jobs in the area.  We are all Americans and that is not the way we live!  For a week or a month yes but after that, they need a place to call home.  

Email me at gaylas@bektel.com if you or someone you know has been displaced by the disaster and need temporary shelter or care, well find a way for you to get here.

360,789,"GF Baser",,"I'm thrilled to have found your posting.  Since the tragedy in New Orleans happened I have had so many thoughts about the flood that happened here in Grand Forks.  What a monumental event it was, and it pales in comparison to the current disaster on the gulf coast.  Being a native to Minnesota I did not experience the events of the GF flood first hand, but my brother did since he was attending college here at the time.  I have heard many accounts of the challenges people experienced leaving the city, finding places to stay, losing their homes, rebuilding their lives.  I also remember being shocked at the number of people who had arrived in our little Minnesota community to stay with family or friends.  The doors to our northern communities opened wide then to help, maybe because we perceived those people to be the same as us.   Many people up here on the frozen tundra have an extreme distrust of people from other places.  Especially ""big"" cities.  I would think that there would be a gathering of people here ready to offer whatever they can to help the ones who are now wearing that familiar coat of misfortune.  What I have heard too many times the last week is that they would love to help someone from New Orleans, but there's just no way of knowing if the people who come to stay will be trustworthy.   Apparently they are afraid of being robbed or murdered or possibly it feels to far away for them to do anything substantial.  Since I moved to the GFAFB with my military husband I have had similar nagative experiences as those mentioned in a previous post while I've been a resident here.  Since I live on the base, I guess I'm officially foreign even though I grew up a few hours away.  I believe that it's just a little town where people have a hard time accepting anything new, and people from other walks of life.  I think scapegoats are found in most communities around here, and the basers are easy targets. I would love for this community to realize that inspite of our different cultures, appearances, ideas and addresses we are all Americans.  Our North Dakota soldiers are fighting side by side with their brothers from the South.  They love, trust and depend on eachother. I would love to see people from New Orleans come to stay here for a while since I believe that people who have experienced this type of tragedy will  be able to offer so much comfort and support.  I would love to offer my own home to someone, but base regulations wouldn't allow that for any significant period of time.  Which has had me thinking about base housing in general.  This base has sectioned off dozens of housing units to be demolished. Not because they are condemned, I actually live in one of the homes that are next in line to be torn down and I love it here.  They are simply older units that the AF doesn't want to pay to maintain.  So they are being demolished, and new units are being built.   This is happening on other bases throughout the country also. It is such a pity that because of the necessity of tightened security we are not able to offer these homeless people from the gulf coast the many homes that could be available to them.  I wonder exactly how much of a national threat these homeless Americans can be. Also to G. Schill who posted above, and anyone else who is interrested, I am providing a web address where people offering housing to the victims of Katrina can post their info.  www.hurricanehousing.org","09/06/05 03:45:13",0,

I think Lost might be one of the very few shows that is better this season than it was last season. I still think they'll barely make it to the end of the season before it starts sucking, but it'll be fun while it lasts. 

I can't believe you are still watching Desperate Housewives. Bree is great, but you'd probably be better of watching old episodes of Melrose Place.

Even better than the Veronica Mars episode with Kim from ANTM was the episode of ANTM in which she wins the guest-starring spot. The girls on the show (ANTM) have a pathological need for a villan: first it was Cassandra, then it was Lisa, then it was Kim. They love hating, but it makes for great tv.

The Office is no good, in my opinion. Very strained, and it's too dumbed down compared to the British version. Every time Steve C. looks at the camera, he's basically saying, ""You Americans are idiots. You would forget this is supposed to be a documentary if I didn't keep looking at you."" Annoying. I don't think it's a class issue, I think it's a writing issue. (""Michael says something offensive but not funny. Michael looks at the camera."")

What do you think of ""Everybody Hates Chris""? I think it's OK, and funnier than practically everything else, but not really appointment television.","11/23/05 11:44:43",0,
736,854,"Rex",,"I watched only one episode of Everybody Hates Chris, and thought it was Cosby 2.0 (or maybe a black version of Malcolm In The Middle), so I gave up. People tell me to try it again, but I just can't do laugh track humor anymore. 

Oh, and I completely forgot my Laguna Beach observation! 

16) Did you ever notice that things seldom <i>happen</i> on Laguna Beach? I mean, events are almost always told instead of seen -- oftentimes, they are told over and over again. Laguna Beach is all about the analysis of history -- an event will happen, and then it will get reportrayed by different characters a dozen times. The weird thing is that the audience saw the event, yet the ""characters"" always reportray it in a way that it didn't actually happen! ","11/23/05 13:03:56",0,

MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE LYRICS

""I'm Not Okay (I Promise)""

Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say.
I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way.
For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took,
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
(I'm not okay)
I told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
(I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book, but the pages all are torn and frayed

I'm okay
I'm okay!
I'm okay, now
(I'm okay, now)

But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay!
(Trust Me)

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
(Okay)

he has not separated church and state, and i believe that G_D will find that unacceptable.  no matter what anyone says Clinton was a great president.  he left us debt free with a balanced budget and a surplus.  bush has been borrowing more and more money from china. does he not realize that they own us.  more and more cells are being put together and we are in deep trouble.  the average american is getting deeper and deeper into debt, but he keeps spending and giving back to the rich.  even the wealthy admit to this.  give tax breaks to the oil companies when their profits just keep growing.  how screwed up can we be?  as screwed up as he wants us to be.  after all his term will be up soon and who cares? certainly not him.  he struts around and portrays himself as a saviour.  he did not even know where his heart was located at the memorial for the people who died at 911.  we are in danger for more attacks...our ports are not protected...our borders are not protected....our young men are being killed partially due to not being properly equipped and protected...our military is spread thin...we are not respected by the world community...our secretary of defense is a dummy and not a military man....he needs to go....global terrorism is much worse, not better...bush has to go, sooner the better.  our country is in deep trouble and it is scary for us the citizens.  
the homeland security is sorely lacking....politics and more politics.  how about stop being political and start protecting our country.  we are not winning in iraq, we invaded another country and we should have stayed in our own backyard and find bin laden.  afghanistan has become a place on the back burner and billions to iraq. does anyone of bush's followers believe that even if bin laden was dead that another leader will not emerge.  dumb and dumber.  for a long time i watched fox news, but not for the past 3 years.  no longer are you fair and balanced, but most decidely one sided.  the war in irag is fostering more hate for the United States and making more danger to us as citizens.b  ","09/26/06 04:23:46",0,

Where in the world did you find this sorry excuse for a man and sorry to be frank but, whoever hired O'reilly must have been on drugs that day.  We need highly educated, respectful and compationate individuals as models to watch on TV, there already so much sadness going on around the world and to add a moron like him is something we can do without.The talking at the sametime something is speaking is totally rude, I understand the time constriction, but, common courtesy which does not seem to exist anymore is very annoying and disturbing to watch nor listen too. We are already in a senseless war that we will never win, men and women are dying in a war that did not really come about due to the WTC attack, we should have hunted and captured Bin Ladin, instead of Sadam, but it's too late now.  This people are born and bread this way, they even train kids a young age to kill, no one and certainly not Bush can change them. We need to leave them alone and let them do as they wish then maybe they will stop attacking us, they feed on anger, and the more angry they get by us medling with their affairs, we need to focus on what's supposedly Bush's priority, and that the United states and the people here, there are people here in our own country who are in need of food, shelter, and medical assistance, we cannot dish out money to help our people but yet we have money to burn for a war that we'll never win, not in Bush's lifetime, nor any one's lifetime, We are born different, the that, we have to respect so as for others to respect ours.

i have the same critique of a lot of new shows, but the dialogue is not believable.  as mentioned by eric, it is not spontaneous at all.  i think there is probably an art in acting for these sorts of shows that is different for others.  basically i've always explained it like nobody is listening to what the other person is saying, but is just waiting to say their line.","10/25/06 12:25:39",0,

7823,1622,"Weierd",,"(I have seen every episode so far.) The Sting lute fiasco was the first bellweather of catastrophe - but it didn't truly signal the end for me.

This weeks episode was horrific.  

(Eli Wallach is a god...and he was stunning in his cameo...but that being said...)  Writing an episode that comes out on the *highly* controversial stance that - ""we think that blacklisting was wrong and it hurt people"" is about as inspired as pointing out that you think the Spanish Inquisition could have been handled better.

Having your idiot ""tour guide"" (wtf with that?) son educate the public about how country hicks are dumb/predictable but - in the end loveable - was the poorest time-filler thread since anything Jon Lovitz was involved in.

And if that thread was not insulting enough to the audience's intellect - to contradict yourself on african american status in a single episode is an act of hypocracy I don't see often.  ""Oh, stereotypes about badonkadonk make me sick.""  ""By the way did I mention that I was a poor inner city youth who ran with a gang, who had a friend murdered and then avenged it, and now love to send chocolates to my friends who are all in prison.""   ...how about you try something original like ""yeah I was poor but I watched alot of Flip Wilson as a kid and had to be a comedian.  Can we hire a black writer, please?""?

Besides that, locking their content, <em>renting out</em> software -- really? -- will only serve to make reading the NYT a huge hassle.  No one will want to bother.  Additionally, it will make it more difficult for people to quote from the NYT (a long-standing tradition) and point back to it, which will inevitably reduce name recognition, let alone their reputation, among younger generations.<br />

9410,2348,"dekadetia",,"So, since this is apparently the place to do it (?), I'll suggest the following: (1) It would be great to never see the same video two weeks in a row. Everyone who is watching this is time-shifting anyway, so if they want to see the video again, they can just play it back again, right? Go into the archives if necessary, just avoid repetition. (2) Make the IDs (artist/title/etc) a little less conspicuous and move them to the lower left-hand corner. It's been done that way forever because it's not as annoying to do it that way. Better still, throw up a title card <em>before</em> the video or something, just stop blocking the screen. And stop throwing up that ""You are watching Subterranean"" graphic in the middle of the video. Because we know. And get rid of the enormous two-headed dog (we know, not possible). (3) I saw that Sean Lennon/Bijou Phillips video one night and it was squished to 1.33, so everyone looked really skinny and the guitar had an oval-shaped hole in it...this was weird. Maybe not your fault, but try your best to run things at the right aspect ratio. (4) If you haven't already, just stop playing that Sean Lennon/Bijou Phillips video altogether. It's easier that way. (5) Ditching the host and interviews is good (they were always painful and pointless anyway), so stick with that. (6) No more Klaxons clips either. With all this effing around, ""The Dive"" actually starts to look like a viable alternative. Play videos! (7) No more barfing glow worms--this isn't Wonder Showzen!

<br />
1. We have actually reduced the amount of times we play the same videos overall, but since every person doesn't watch every show every week and the record labels that make these videos would be quite displeased with one play that is not going to be possible. TiVo or DVR and fast forward is my advice. Now that we don't have host segments about half the videos in the hour each week are new.<br />
<br />
2. It is my fondest wish that we put the song chyrons back in a normal place and stop running the ""You Are Watching Subterranean"" message. Unfortunately that is standard MTV2 formatting and we all have to make due with it. If it is truly irritating to you, like the repetitive videos, then I recommend watching the show on MTV.com on Monday mornings. We post a link to it on the blog each week. Then there are no screen interruptions and you get to watch the parts you want only, but you will get some commercials.<br />
<br />
3. That's how Sean Lennon wanted it.<br />
<br />
4. Again, fast forward.<br />

<br />
I find Twitter fascinating as well but for a much different reason. I heard about it quite a while ago, and have a bunch of friends who are ga-ga over it. However, each time I've visited and planned on starting an account, I always get stopped at part where I'm supposed to upload my picture. It must've happened a half-dozen times so far.<br />
<br />
Everytime I think to myself, why am I doing this? And I don't. Weirdly, up until Twitter I'd sign up for everything and I was totally into the idea of the social web.<br />
<br />
I can't tell if it's the fact that I've got a 3 year-old, my own web projects & a TV show to run (in other words I'm too busy), if I've finally just gotten too old or that there's something inherently different to me about Twitter than those other things (blogging, MySpace, YT, etc.).<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll go do it today, just to say I've done it. <br />

First, let me pick a gender. I mean, I like Barack Obama as much as the next guy, and in some sense I may want to ""boff"" him, but, really, honestly, I prefer the ladies.<br />

Second, while the tetris-like game play is an interesting twist on the original FKM idea, it's a little tedious. At least lemme use the down button like in real tetris.<br />

The sad thing is Texas Hold 'em is basically poker for morons. Our best hope is that somehow all of the sitting, smoking and drinking will make the guys mess up the players gonads and therefore they will not reproduce.

<br />
I fell in love with her work years ago, when it was brilliant and edgy and insightful and heading towards being a female Lenny Bruce/Bill Hicks.<br />
Then she sort of made a 90 degree turn, moved away from the very smart satire -- less Dorothy Parker, more fart jokes.<br />
<br />
Her movie was a great disappointment -- WTF with all the songs? -- as her subject matter veered toward dumber matters. She still has the capacity to shock and amuse, but I ifnd it off just a tad. <br />
<br />
TSSP was thrown onto TiVo as soon as it could, and I am more than willing to give it a chance to find its voice; The 1st episode was amusing -- but there's something missing from her material that I cannot place. <br />
 <br />
Fucking Jimmy Kimmel was good for her career, but bad for her art . .  .  (yeah, you can read that both ways)","02/04/07 06:41:17",0,

9040,2118,"Eric",,"Agree that the Dakota Fanning thing was superb. I'm not overly hot on this season, though, and not overly hot on female cast. I thought the rest of this episode blew hard. I don't feel like Kristen Wiig is good at all. I think the best things she's got going are somebody's Aunt on WU, and Target checkout lady, and I think those things stink. Bush-league impressions with no real identity. <br />
<br />
Maya Rudolph continues to be an underachiever, and by that I mean that I think she is super super super talented and could be ruling that show or others, but seems to be slumming long term. It's like having a really bright person in your company whose mind is somewhere else and who just does the bare minimum to scrape by, with the occasional standout flash, but no real interest or initiative. She seems to do what she does effortlessly, and be bored with it, and you know she's got so much more. <br />
<br />
I think Andy Samberg is il bomba. A couple of the other guys are OK but not standouts. Fred Armison has some excellent stuff in him but rarely seems to really hit. The time he was the giant parrot in a previous season was spleen-poppingly funny. I'm glad dead weight Horatio Sanz and Finesse Mitchell are gone. Keenan Thompson seems like he could be more, but so far seems to be following the Maya Rudolph path of I don't give a shit, but with less talent. He always seems to still be himself to a large degree regardless of what character he's playing, which seems lazy and sort of entitled.<br />
<br />
I discovered Lily Allen on this week's episode and couldn't be happier. I can't remember the last time I saw an unknown on there and wound up saying Eureka. I now know she's been out in the UK and elsewhere for a while, but I'd never heard of her before. Anybody who can sneak the words ""crack whore"" into a sunny, fun, feelgood summer hit is to cherished, studied, and given a parade. <br />
<br />
And what a lovely, rich voice she has. It sounds like it belongs on an older person, like it comes from a soul that has seen more than her 21 years.<br />
<br />
The juxtaposition of images of unvarnished fuck-you London youth culture with smooth, soulful, polished, carefree melodies and infectious pop hooks just creates the most delicious contrasts. Remember how Housemartins and Beautiful South would sing happy songs about miserable topics? This reminds me of that, not in sound but in concept. Similarly, remember how Morrissey would sing songs that completely and unashamedly laid bare his pettyness and other character flaws (which we all have but won't admit) and offered no apology? Lily's lyrics have that sort of honesty and confidence too. For example she sings tra-la-la happy in ""Smile"" while relishing in her ex's pain. No remorse and a smile to boot! Love it. And in another one she talks about laying around her own dirt all weekend. This she sings from her frilly dress and glamorous look. Very nice.","02/05/07 16:20:14",0,

9677,2573,"Eric",,"Also I think that t-shirt validation psychology is much more of an overt proposition than adhering to other fashion trends. Maybe someone wears super premium jeans because they want people to look at them and value them higher. But maybe people notice they are costly super premium jeans and maybe they don't. Or maybe the jeans just indirectly contribute to the person's overall image. Maybe someone sees you at the party in those jeans and thinks your whole presentation is very well put together. Maybe you don't see them even doing this as you chat on the other side of the room. The jeans have served there purpose, but below the radar. Whatever happens with people's perceptions of the jeans or things like them, it's usually below the level of worded thoughts or acknowledgement. And if noticed, there is usually no verbal exchange about it.<br />
<br />
But when you wear a shirt that has a clever/ironic message, you're saying, ""these are my clever thoughts or ones that I am associating myself with - evaluate them and return a specific result about me. Decide in your head that I am to be raised a few notches for my cleverness."" And it's like you're a walking billboard. Wherever you go, your validation proposition is the one thing about you that draws the attention. You become that guy with the t-shirt. No one will miss it and everyone has to play the game - read the message, judge, assign tshirt's value to wearer, adjust estimation of wearer. The wearer sees the observer going through this process because they have to be facing you, looks at the observer in anticipation as they compute, and there is that moment where the observer makes the actual assignment of points, whether out loud as a statement or just as a smile and nod from the guy across from you on the subway, and the wearer inwardly or even outwardly experiences/expresses pleasure at having just been validated.<br />
<br />
There's just something more direct, verbal, conscious, neurotic, and one-dimensional about that. Again, I think there's something sort of quietly sad underlying it (""Accept me!""), though acceptance is a powerful driver in humans.<br />
<br />
But at the same time, as I said, it also exists on the level of harmless fun and can be a way to find people who appreciate the same kinds of things. I like some of the funny ones you post here. ""Wearing my Twitter shirt"" was my favorite.<br />

<br />
But to play along, your argument seems to maintain that the annoying factor of t-shirts is that they are overt messages (as opposed to covert signs of cool, like jeans). But maybe that can be turned on it's head: t-shirts are transparent signifiers, devoid of the usual trappings of wealth and cool.<br />
<br />
Or maybe not, I'm not sure. While before I wanted to compare t-shirts and jeans, now I want to change my comparison to t-shirts and dialog. That is, when I meet someone for the first time, I have this tendency to yap and yap and yap and try to be interesting. If you were critical of this kind of personality, you might accuse me of the same things that you critique t-shirts for. I can easily imagine someone saying it's the ""direct, verbal, conscious, neurotic, and one-dimensional"" Rex -- but it's really just <em>me</em>. That's how I am!<br />

We're all vulnerable little softies on the inside and have basic instinctual drives for things like self worth and validation and acceptance. Call them weaknesses or just being human. (Morrissey was always great about unapologetically acknowledging/admitting these little things. It's why he's so refreshing! Cuts right to the quick.)<br />
<br />
Your dialog comparison is a good one and does cut more directly to the essence of the matter. I do the same thing - essentially try to impress with my witty repartee. ""Hey everybody, revise your estimations of me. Aren't I clever? Don't you wish you were as clever as me? Raise my rating, please. Feed me."" It's kind of sad. I think it's born of insecurity at some level. But like you, it's just me! I do deliberately try to resist this urge, though, and just try to be still and see what happens. I don't have to be the center of attention and don't have to wow people with smarts or humor. I can just be even keel and they can think whatever they like. That's the plan anyway. It stinks a bit because I like being clever, damn it!<br />
<br />
As for overt/covert, shirts vs. jeans, I agree, the tee is much more direct. It's the bridge between styles/clothes and speech, because... uhh, it's speech on clothes. All of it says ""like me"" however.<br />
<br />
I don't know that I find the shirts annoying, as you characterize and as I may have implied. It's just been a psychological case study I've been mulling over for a while. Something in me is sad for all of us, for these desperate/tiny cries for acceptance and what they imply about how we feel about ourselves way down deep below thought. I want us to feel 100% comfortable, be 100% genuine, not have to rely on artifice or salesmanship, and not feel like we have to impress anyone, especially in order to be liked and accepted.","05/17/07 19:21:55",0,

An interesting take, but I think really that Facebook (or social network of your choice) <em>plus</em> Wikipedia is what belongs in that third spot.

This isn't an ethical or moral issue, and it isn't about skewering the news or a liberal bias - whether you're a journalist for a news channel, radio station or print publication you have editors and it's the job of the editor to deliver fair and balanced news as well as the duty of the journalist. I would hope that if any journalist delivered a skewed story, biased in one way or another, that it would be treated as an editorial piece and presented in that way. These journalists are private citizens and the fact that they donate to the green party, cheney 08' election funds or to the KKK is not a matter for public opinion. <br />
<br />
The MSNBC piece struck me as careless, manufactured ""journalism"" and the fact that it's treated as an exposé of sorts says a hell of a lot more about the standards of MSNBC than it does about the individual journalists and the media outlets they work for.<br />

9910,2804,"Eric",,"This reminds me of the east Asian way of doing things, at least in my experience with Chinese and Japanese business dealings. They'll never say no outright. It is apparently rooted in the concept of ""face"" as in not causing you to lose it and be shamed. They might say ""we'll try"" or ""that is interesting"" but that is your clue that ain't gonna happen. Also, in Japanese dealings, apparently waiting for a long time and saying nothing is a common bargaining technique. When your counterpart says nothing and keeps putting you off for months, you begin to squirm and concede. This can actually work well in dealings over here too. Cialdini outlines this as a technique in his book called like Influence: the Psychology of Persuasion. It's very awkward when you first try it because we're just culturally compelled to speak and respond in the silent spaces. But when you're on the phone with that guy, and you need him to come around more to your position, just try saying nothing and not responding.  If after a while of silence he's like, ""Are... are you there?"" be like, ""Yep"" and still say nothing.  And when he says ""so uhh, so are we set on $200,000?"" you say nothing. Often the other guy will start conceding after long enough. ""Well I mean we could look at knocking that down to 190 if we reconfigure a bit..."" That's what my real estate buddy says anyway. I feel like an experienced businessperson would just call the bluff and say ""well call me back when you're ready to respond"" or even ""You say you heard me. Will you be responding?"" And if silent, just be like, ""I'll talk to you later.  Anyway, RE buddy says it can work.","06/26/07 18:26:29",0,

2) For the second lock, you may need to look to the stars. They will help you find<br />
HAAS who will lead your way.<br />

3) The third lock will require you to extinguish all lights but one. Only with one light<br />

10062,2883,"snlfanforever",,"Cloverfield is an ARG started by the producer of LOST- J.J. Abrams and Paramount Pictures. The untitled trailer before the movie Transformers, holds all the clues you need to start the game. <br />
<br />
I played The LOST expierience for FIVE months over the LOST hiatus last year. It was very fun and involving. This one, however, is very difficult!<br />
<br />
When you are involved in the game (and know what is REALLY going on) go to ethanhaas.org . You will find a series of links at the bottom of your screen. These are ALL related to the game!!!!<br />
<br />
One of the links is THE HANSO FOUNDATION! I clicked on the link and saw a letter from Hanso, explaining his situation and his newly found freedom.<br />
There seems to be some text on the bottom of the letter. I've never seen it before! It's hard to read. Has Hanso been infiltrated by Cloverfield? Or the other way around?<br />
<br />
J.J. Abrams loves a good hunt and a good laugh! He has SET-UP and DENIED websites (ethanhaaswasright.com) (ethanhaaswaswrong.com) to keep one step ahead of the intellegent and relentless findings of us, the players. <br />
<br />
He's gotta keep this thing going until January, remember?<br />
<br />
Dedicated gamers and fans, Don't believe the hype! Go to those websites and play the game! <br />
Abrams has, in the past, SET-UP and DENIED several websites throughout the LOST expierience that were actually involved.<br />
No more wild goose chases! I've learned my lesson.<br />
<br />
I know the ethanhaaswasright.com are for Cloverfield, because each time you finish a piece of the puzzle, you get a video clip from a person who is hiding underground seeking the truth.<br />
(Sounds like The LOST Expiereince to me....) <br />
<br />
Also, the name Ethan strikes me as odd. Ethan Rom, Ethan Haas? Puzzles and video clips? How can anyone tell me that those ""fake"" websites are not part of J.J.'s wonderous creation!!!! He's laughing at us, people!<br />
He states in an interview that there are websites out there that haven't even been found, yet! UNTIL I CAME ALONG!!!!!<br />
<br />
Another interesting side note: <br />
Cloverfield premiers in January. LOST starts again in February. <br />
The names Ethan along with Hanso, are both tied to Cloverfield and LOST. <br />
Abrams is keeping us busy for yet, another Summer, until both premiere.<br />
How genius!!!!! <br />
<br />
Isn't it cool to be a part of something that only select people know about? <br />
If you've already been playing...<br />
 F.Y.I: August 1, 2007 will be big!<br />
F.Y.I: 1+18+08 = 27 2+7=9 ... The number on ""Yellow Girl"" in the pic of Rob drinking!<br />

1) My above post makes no sense. I am simultaneously trying to say that 'everything is text' and therefore 'Trapped...' is 'art', while maintaining the high art/low art distinction. That was dumb.<br />
<br />
2) But - you're going to think I'm insane for saying this - the corollary to 'Trapped' is... WB's Girlfriends. Yeah: Girlfriends.<br />
<br />
Why? It contains the same weird mix of comedy and sincerity - i.e. a laughtrack joke in the middle of a discussion of abortion or rape. And it does exactly what 'Trapped' does - constantly and simultaneously staying on the edge of verisimilitude, camp, irony and comedy, but never committing to any of them. <br />
<br />
So, to get all academic, as art/media recognise the impossibility of ever arriving at 'an end' in all attempts at *either* representation or critique, the phase of the post-ironic is the refusal to do anything but acknowledge its own failure as-representation/critique. <br />

Regardless of your ""suspicions"" toward M.I.A.'s implementations of empty, superficial political rhetoric, it remains empty and superficial. Trying to distance the artist from this fact by inventing an alleged character is extra-textual. There's nothing in M.I.A.'s music that supports your claim that she's ""acting"" out fictional or composite characters in her songs.<br />
<br />
The comparison with ""starchitects"" is just fanboy gushing. I cannot comprehend the urge that M.I.A. fans have for elevating her beyond a purveyor of moderately competent dance music. She flies around the world and hears sounds and incorporates them into her music. Wow! Nobody's ever done that before! Every review of <em>Kala</em> insists on picking apart every minute aspect of the record for some sort of post-modern high-art meaningfulness but it just isn't there. She samples, she makes beats, she covers some foreign songs, makes meaningless references to revolutionary movements... this isn't exactly groundbreaking stuff, guys.<br />

Heads of state, any politician, philosophers, writers, artists whether visual, dance or music, actors, entertainers, captains of industry ...... Charlies interviews are unmatched IMO. I remember when Peter OToole was interviewed on The Daily Show (I love JS! and the d show) but the interview was not very good, but when CR did an interview with POT (how do you abbreviate that name?) it was a wonderful piece. There are a myriad of fab interviews that CR has done, but these guys?? even when he asked a real question they gave back nothing. Yep, it was not a very good CR interview, but the interviewees were vapid in their responses and had little to say about their art or their approach to it. <br />
<br />
Its a pity that CR even aired it.  If he is out of his element with regard to the Beastie Boys then no great loss. But about being out of his element with musicians in general this I do not understand? I recall great interviews with Wynton Marsalis, James Levine,  Tony Bennett, David Bowie, Paul Simon, Simon Rattle,  Dave Matthews, Bela Fleck, Yo-Yo Ma, Mick Jagger, Annie Lennox. I am reminded of the interview that Gene A**H*** Simmons did with Terry Gross on Fresh Air. The BBs werent ofensive in that vein but no more useful. They were just projecting attitude either witholding or did not have anything edifying to say about their art. <br />

10347,3117,"Nav","scrawledinwax.com","I think the reason there's so much dissection of something like M.I.A. is the postmodern split between artist and work and artistic intention and the final (and, of course, never final) product. <br />
<br />
You could write a fucking dissertation on the performance of masculinity and race on a 50 Cent album, despite the fact that it's probably a bit stupid. M.I.A. seems to work because she draws on so many different frames of reference. Right or wrong, vacuous or political, that's the reason it's so ripe for analysis - what is a music review except an attempt to assert one aesthetic/intellectual frame of reference over another. Why else say ""this is not original"" if not to insist on the need for originality, or state that ""the beats are weak"" if not to argue the superiority of particular sorts of beats? So M.I.A. gets to the impetus for a public debate over authenticity, genre and the politics of aesthetics (and vice versa) regardless of what Maya herself intends.<br />

His other big idea: a subscription model. NEWSFLASH, RICK: it's already been tried, and it has failed miserably because -- and here's another news flash -- PEOPLE WANT TO OWN THEIR MUSIC. And he has the nerve to be bitching about DRM at the same time he is touting a subscription model. All the crap about him being a guru just makes it all the more annoying.

As a talent scout, there's no one better in America (not even Jay-Z), but it's questionable that this transfers over to wise business decisions. <br />
<br />
Two things I'll say though: 1) he's right about the industry needing to do something or a tech company will buy up the remnant inventory of these dying record labels and 2) I was surprised all these music execs are on record as saying they support the subscription models.","09/02/07 17:53:27",0,

I think a double hyphen (if your wp doesn't autoconvert it to a dash) bookended with spaces is nice and clear. Observe.<br />

From my informal poll of folks afterwards, it definitely seemed to divide the audience, with <a href=""http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34146"" target=""_blank"">Harry's review on AICN</a> representing one end of the spectrum, but the majority of people I talked to congregating on <a href=""http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34163"" target=""_blank"">the other side</a>. I'd have to say both points of view are valid.<br />
<br />
It is definitely a film that demands repeat viewing... but I think it's questionable whether it earns the right to make that demand. Some may say yes, most will probably say no (which, come to think of it, is probably true of most movies, but I think it's a bigger problem for this movie.) I'm glad I saw the film, but have no intention of ever giving it another two-and-a-half hours of my life (nor am I particularly motivated to read the three graphic novel prequels).<br />
<br />
Summarily, I would call it a fascinating but flawed cinematic curiosity. It's a really weird, inventive, stylishly crafted movie that has no right to exist in a rational universe, and while I'm kind of tickled that it does, it may just be too ambitious and disjointed for its own good. There's just so much going on in so many directions, it feels like several movies* thrown in a blender set on ""Liquify"". (If you like that sort of thing, Merry Christmas.)<br />
<br />
The film is populated by a who's who of actors cast radically against type to the point of perpetual distraction. It sort of takes you out of the movie. (Over and over again, though it did crack me the heck up to see Christopher Lambert appear out of nowhere as an arms dealer operating out of an ice cream truck.)<br />

I think most of these writers are simply upset because the internet has deprofessionalized their craft. So in one sense, these writers are right: ""professional writing"" is worse off. Society as a whole, however, is far more educated. ","10/10/07 22:10:34",0,

<br />
""this stuff is awful! how can anyone live in this first-draft world?""<br />
<br />
when i read stuff on blogs -- whether by my friends, the new york times, gawker inc., any big blog network, my own stuff, whatever -- i am left with the impression that pretty much no one is writing second drafts, and i think the writing seriously suffers from it. arguments are poorly supported, sentences are badly structured, and so forth.<br />
<br />
when i look back on papers i wrote for school or for the local paper, i can see how i spent so much time getting things right, backing up arguments, etc. -- in other words, doing all the things you should do before trying to use your writing to convince someone of something or accurately describe something. but nowadays, it's extremely rare for me to see any evidence of that kind of process on any site. <br />

I've done research on it that shows that the longer students blog, the more thoughtful and reflective they are in their writing. That speaks more to what they try to do than how ""finished"" their entries are, but the gist is that while they may not edit entry by entry, they become better writers over time because writing has become a habit, and when you do anything regularly you usually get better at it. <br />
<br />
Anyway, blogs just occupy a different context than other forms of writing. I kind of reject the whole notion that blogs are *supposed* to be something else: finished academic essays, journalism, polished memoirs, whatever.  So much of the handwringing is based on trying to cram them into the template of a pre-existing genre. Marshall McLuhan was wrong; people don't use new media to do the work of the old, they just insist on using the old media as metaphors for the new.<br />

While it's true that indie rock was pretty white in the mid-90s it's ignorant to say it's stayed that way.  And SFJ knows that, he's just trolling.<br />
<br />
""About five years ago, indie rockers began to rediscover the pleasures of rhythm.""  SFJ wrote that.  In march of this year.  He knows how ridiculous he sounds and yet he cherry picks artists to name drop because that's how trolls get down.<br />
<br />
Towards the end he writes ""Thirty years ago, Banhart might have attempted to imitate R. Kellys perverse and feather-light soul. Now hes just a fan.""  And it is true.  Banhart hasn't covered R. Kelly.  But he's covered Lauryn Hill.  And The Mountain Goats have covered R. Kelly.  And Bonnie Prince Billy has covered R. Kelly.  Way to cherry pick in order to make bad points.<br />

<br />
When we exit these worlds we move around the real world and start to find amazing similarities to the gaming environment BUT we don't have the handy tools we had in the gaming world to manipulate the game world, hence... we are now creating tools to manipulate the real world that are in a sense creations from that gaming world. Its not that reality is a game, but that we are changing reality to BE like a game. Why? perhaps we want to be able to control our reality the way we can in a game. <br />
<br />
Even playing realistic environment games for a short period I think will begin to have a huge long term effect on culture as we move forward and game environments become more and more advanced and realistic, it could genuinely present us with a crisis of reality and the shortcomings of 'life' that we just have to take for granted and accept. <br />

<br />
This sense of accumulation could also connected to to you bringing up dating-as-gaming. I think that's a spot-on observation, especially if we think of those web accumulations (Facebook friends, scrobbled tracks etc.) as cultural capital. To wit, the more 'achievements' you have, the more marketable you are in the game of dating - and, you could argue, life. If gaming is on some level based on systems of exchange - this object is worth so many experience points or this object will give you health - then this all fits in terms of cultural/economic zeitgeist.<br />
<br />
As usual though, I think I disagree about data being at the root of this. Not that I'm saying it isn't a factor - but I think the sort of Baudrillardian sense of reality as mediated through images probably plays a role too, as we become accustomed to the idea of building and manipulating our lives as sets of images rather than people, data or 'real ideas'.<br />

<br />
""The idea of money as a source of social memory was also crucial for John Locke who figures prominently in our story as the philosopher who inaugurated the modern age of democratic revolutions. Locke was obsessed with moneys role both in establishing a progressive social order and in subverting it as its criminal antithesis. Indeed he believed that money launched humanity from the state of nature onto the road to civil government. As long as mens possessions were limited to perishable products, the scope for property was restricted. Money, by offering a durable store of value convertible against all useful things, unleashed the potential for property accumulation and for the intergenerational transmission of inequality. For Locke then, money was indispensable to that development of cultural memory on which civilisation depends."" http://www.thememorybank.co.uk/book/chapter-1/<br />

But it could just be a number at this point, maybe interchangeable with a barcode. Much like your email address or, these days, your cellphone number, this number/address is always yours no matter where you go. These numbers are maintained in a central database, let's say by the US Postal Service since they've got less and less to do these days anyway. Whenever you move, you just tell them the new address and that physical address is associated with your same ol' number in place of your old physical address. Your friends, merchants, and business contacts always mail things to the same ""address"".  You never have to change it except that one time with the Post Office. People like Fedex subscribe to this database to deliver stuff marked with these new number/addresses.<br />
<br />
I suppose the only drawback is that you don't get the junk mail/ex-girlfriend escape opportunity that currently comes when you change addresses. Curse you, Val-pak! (And Valerie)<br />

<br />
To me, Fairey is much more graphic designer than he is artist. Us designers make quite a little habit of compiling graphics, type, photos, and the like from disparate sources into new compositions. It's what we do.<br />
<br />
Fairey shouldn't try to pawn off the appropriations of other people's work as his own any more than Dr. Dre should claim that he wrote the musical hook for California Love (he didn't, it's from Joe Cocker's ""Woman to Woman"") or Notorious B.I.G. should claim he created the groove for Big Poppa (it's a sample from The Isley Brother's ""Between the Sheets"").<br />

Instead, I wish the author had focused on what Fairey's actually trying to say with his art, and whether his appropriations are being put to good use. The article has an interesting thesis at its center: the author believes that Fairey's art is symptomatic of a creative bankruptcy combined with a raging egocentricity. Frankly, I was hoping for something more along the lines of Charlie Brooker's takedown of Banksy:<br />

<br />
There's a lady who sits next to me here at work who is the consummate poor drunkard...always getting fall down drunk, comes in Monday morning explaining either her/her roommate's trip to the hospital to anyone that will listen - with caveat of ""I'm never drinking again""...and repeat that every week.<br />
<br />
Ipso facto, I don't like her...if you're going to be a drunk, be a classy drunk, right?<br />
<br />
Anyways, a few weeks back she mentioned how much she loved Juno because she went to school in St. Cloud and felt at home with the references.  I don't have cable and I tend not to follow movies as closely as I used to so I had only briefly heard of the movie...went home, watched the trailer online and felt weird about it...<br />
<br />
How could I not like the movie with such a cast, I thought...but then, what would that say about me if I then identified with this piss-poor human who I have the poor luck of having to sit next to for eight hours a day?<br />
<br />
One of my friends invited me out shortly after and we went and saw it...and I liked it...and felt remorse...<br />
<br />
But then folks such as yourself chimed in with positive words and balanced my thoughts out...if I'm in the wrong for liking it...at least I'm in good company (now).","01/07/08 12:55:24",0,

<br />
1) The merger won't help Yahoo or Microsoft.<br />
<br />
2) The merger won't help or hurt Google.<br />
<br />
3) People who think Microsoft is ""evil"" are trapped in some whack mythology from the '90s. Microsoft is harmless, and it will be continue to be harmless even if the merger happens. Hating Microsoft is about as relevant and meaningful as hating Britney Spears.<br />
<br />
4) Google's power right now is significantly more frightening -- and it's nothing resembling the battle that Microsoft posed. Rather than a battle over software and systems, Google poses a potential monopoly over networks, information, and media. But in 10 years Google will hopefully seem as nefarious as Jamie Lynn Spears.<br />
<br />
5) This merger talk was mostly boring UNTIL the names NBC-Univeral and News Corp started being dropped. Aliances here are what could really this into something interesting.... but probably not.

But I think the problem you'll run into is how this will all be framed in the coming Techmeme clusterfuck. Microsoft's 'evil' dominance of OS/software is not wanted because of unfair business practices i.e. they are breaking the sacrosanct rules of 'the market'. But if everyone uses Google for search - and YouTube for video etc. etc. - then the uniformity of who provides access to information and media is simply a product of how ""the market has spoken"" whereby ""people have chosen what's best for themselves"". The consolidation of the flow of information is, to be totally cynical, not as important as 'what's good for business' as dictated by the principles of the invisible hand etc. The fact that Microsoft responded using the same discourse by talking about monopolies/revenue streams rather than knowledge will only compound the problem.","02/03/08 18:25:05",0,

I wouldn't expect anyone to vote solely on this video, but 1) at least the video is based on content, poetic or no; and 2) it may influence people to actually give Obama a look, check out his issues, etc.  <br />
<br />
The problem is that there are a lot of low information voters out there who only know Obama based on world news tonight coverage, and from that it's easy to think he's all style, no substance.  In fact, he has mind-numbing amounts of substance, but you have to look for it, as the broadcast networks don't report in-depth substance.<br />
<br />
Videos like this are a funny thing.  When you support its cause (like I do), it's easy to see its potential for doing good.  When you don't support it's cause (like Russion propaganda films), they're very scary.

All right -- this is a weird one. I went to college in the rural Midwest, and we used to subsist on two kinds of pizza: the taco pizza (which had hamburger meat and taco sauce under the cheese, and lettuce, tomatoes and taco chips on top after it came out of the oven, and was cut into wedges like New York pizza), and the ham, pineapple and sauerkraut pizza, on flat crust, cut into squares.<br />

Actually, what Louis and Jane were doing in Holland was publishing a nearly forgotten text-heavy magazine called ""Electric Word"".  They took the groundbreaking attitude that instead of writing about printers, monitors, and software, they would write about the cool things people were doing with them.  They folded the magazine after about a year, moved back to the States, found some funding, a major distributor, and that look, and the rest is history.","02/11/08 15:02:21",0,

But that first bit from RS is unsettling. It's like we all knew she was way more savvy and cunning than the image she tried to project yet had nowhere near the savvy or cunning to deal with the reality of her fame.<br />

I'm sure this has been said before, but the thing that fascinates me is how Brit became a blank text for anyone and everyone: she was the wholesome pin-up girl for thirteen year-old boys, then the fetishised, trampy crush of fifty year-old men; third-wave feminists thought her provocativeness was great, second-wave ones saw it as everything they fought for, lost; she lived the ""American dream"" and then basically ripped up and threw-up on the ideals of fame, wealth and success... she basically became both the light and dark of contemporary notions of cultural capital, laying bare the seedy unconscious of modern social/economic/cultural systems to the public as if to say ""these are the consequences you never see"".<br />

<br />
Typically when we think of picking parts of reality and adding in some social commentary, we get satire on the other side of the equals sign. GTA, however, walks some entirely different path.<br />
<br />
GTA feels fun because it's guilt free social debauchery set in a movie set version of NYC. I don't like the idea of dying, or going to jail, but I wouldn't mind mowing down some pedestrians in the game's equivalent Times Square (or in my neck of the woods, Jackson Heights / Cervesa Heights.) All the fun of murdering, drug dealing and killing people in a protracted NYC without any of the bad. Sounds like fun to me.<br />

16615,4237,"Nav","scrawledinwax.com","This is awesome. Don't really have time for anything well thought-out or something like 'an answer', but:<br />
<br />
1) For what it's worth, I think you've asked the right questions, particularly in emphasising the relationship between fantasy, desire and reality. What's interesting is that the 'release' of being violent in GTA4 is, you could argue, produced by the other (un)realistic texts that deal with the same sorts of issues. <br />
B) A quote from Will Wright today: """"What I want to do is craft this landscape of experiences where the player has a huge degree of control over what they encounter,"" he says. ""I think that's what games have as an advantage over any other form of media; that the player is half the author of the experience if the game is done well - or even more so. I think this is the first form of medium which has really achieved that and it allows us access to emotional regions that are inaccessible to linear narrative.""<br />
C) I'm not sure it's fair to say that lefty cultural critics are about social realism, particularly when they've come to be dominated by post-structuralist approaches to 'reality-as-text(s)'.<br />
D) Related: one way to think about verisimilitude is that it is often an attempt to produce or textualise reality in a particular way (i.e. the 'realness' of The Hills is as productive as it is reactive). Thought of that way, the virtual - like the aesthetic before it - is always a space one returns from, rather than escapes to. Why this is especially neat in gaming is that one produces the text one wants to, in a way that goes well beyond reader-response theory.<br />
E) This is all kinda' obvious and a bit stupid, but hopefully someone will take it up more thoroughly.","05/04/08 17:40:09",0,

And, personally, I think you are doing the design work of John Plunkett and Barbara Kuhr a bit of a disservice by comparing their work to a Pat Benetar video. Yes, it looks a little dated now, but it was striking back then. Plus, they were doing AMAZING things with spot colors and print techniques. Yes, the neon stuff was overplayed, but their pre-press and production art was second to none, IMHO. What is commonplace now in graphic design and print production, they were doing with what amounted to sticks and stone tablets. I worked in pre-press and a color houses in the 90s and Wired always blew me away with what they were able to pull off.<br />

While it won't bring back the unfortunate puppy in Iraq, consider adopting an unwanted animal from your local shelter. And please, be sure to spay or neuter your dog or cat. Hopefully, the marines responsible for this puppy killing will be neutered as well.<br />

Now if only Amerikans could muster such outrage to the holocaust Israel is inflicting on Gaza...<br />

occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />

She doesn't quite sound like a professional singer in terms of timing or hitting all the notes just right, but that's partly endearing and the rest forgivable - I mean unless you were expecting her to break the old actors-shouldn't-sing-and-vice-versa axiom (I'm looking at you, Hasselhoff). I like her voice. I liked the slight bit of husk in it when she was singing Falling Down. Very cute. And I like it in this one for different reasons. It sounds like somebody I remember, like Siouxie or the girl from This Mortal Coil or the one from Curve or somebody. She also sounds like she's putting on the singing role like a character, as in not being timid. She's laying it out there knowing she's not a top tier singer but is owning it fully. I think that's what I like best - you can tell she's really enjoying it. It's not an album I'll be buying or downloading but I think it's nice and also neat that she's doing it. It doesn't hurt that she's hot and likable, but to counteract the possible hot girl pass I might subconsciously be issuing her, I try to ask myself whether I'd like the music if it was Kelly Osbourne singing it.

As far as having a worthwhile perspective, I would probably argue the opposite. Because I count nearly every person mentioned in this article as a friend, most as legit friends not ""NYC Friends,"" that subspecies of friendship based upon convenience and career opportunity, I probably have the least valuable insight here. I actually hired Emily for her first job after Gawker -- she quit after a week, citing the need to work on this article as the reason. I can believe it, as it looks painful and difficult to write. I'm sure she's having a crazy week.<br />
<br />
Because of that, and for several other reasons, I'm the least insightful person to ask about this story. That isn't because of personal bias; rather, it's that my perspective is simply the least interesting. If I'm curious about anything, it's what the rest of America thinks about this first-person account of the rise and fall of self-exposure. Your perspective, untarnished by the noisy fracas, is sincerely more valuable than mine.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, some of my own self-analysis:<br />
<br />
I won't shut up about how NYC-centric the mediascape has become. Spilling beer on myself every night, I constantly (and annoyingly) tout my midwestern aesthetics, a blend of passive-aggressive humor and ""friendship over career"" ethics. It's a crutch, and sometimes I overplay these cards, which my friends subtly tease me about. (Thanks for going easy on me, Lock.) Ask me about <em>30 Rock</em> and <em>Gossip Girl</em>, and I'll celebrate them as wonderful creations -- and then I'll immediately follow it up with a rant about how inherently flawed they are, tone-deaf to the rest of America and lacking in a populist vision that anyone west of Hoboken can identify with. So much pop culture feels like it was made for me and my friends, which is entirely the problem with so much pop culture. (Despite receiving overwhelming press attention, both <em>30 Rock</em> and <em>Gossip Girl</em> are ratings failures, which no one here seems to realize. And both are obsessed with media and New York City. Coincidence?)<br />

<br />
What does this have to do with Emily's article? Maybe a little, maybe a lot. Again, I wonder what you think.<br />
<br />
As long as I'm being obscure, I'll say something else about my relationship to this city. I go out to lunch almost every day with someone new, usually someone who works for a media company or a dot-com. With nearly no exceptions, there is always a moment in every conversation where Gawker comes up. And again with nearly no exceptions, the person chomping on a salad across from me confides how she has been wronged by Gawker, how her depiction was unfair, how she thinks the entire aesthetic is reprehensible.<br />
<br />
I never know what to say to these people. I've been slammed online too (VALLEYWAG!!!), and although it sucks, I just sorta roll with it. I'm not sure if that makes me jaded or bloggy or just lucky.<br />
<br />
Have I made enough obscure points yet?<br />
<br />
Just one more: I know all the former Gawker editors somewhat well; Balk and Doree the least, Choire and Jess the best, Spiers who I feel the most constitutionally similar to. (Pareene is my favorite, but of course I appreciate the Minnesotan.) They are each very, very, very distinct individuals, yet they're constantly grouped as <em>a kind of person</em>, especially by other people in media. Even other bloggers speak of Gawker as some sort of monolithic identity, an image that must be miserable to carry around day to day. This is curious, but I can think of only one similarity between them all: none of them seem proud of having worked for Gawker<sup>1</sup>.<br />

<br />
For the record, as if that actually matters, I'm a fan of Gawker<sup>2</sup>. You can count me among the people who, regrettably, thinks Denton is something of a genius, though I'll be quick to point out the flaws of this genius, both to him and anyone who asks. A couple months ago, I was out drunk with Klosterman<sup>3</sup>, talking about Gawker. ""I just don't think history will remember it well,"" he said of the site. It was an off-hand comment, but it has stuck with me. While it has strange historical echoes that make me think of both George W. Bush and William Randolph Hearst at the same time, it became lodged in my brain because I had never even thought to pose the legacy question.<br />
<br />
But now that it's out there, I'm very interested.<br />
<br />
You want to know what I think of Emily's article? You made it this far and you deserve an answer: I think it's very smart and disturbingly self-aware, like all the people here that I love with deep suspicion.<br />
<br />
I can't believe I just blogged that. Stupid commenters.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<sup>3</sup> Chuck is actually an interesting person in this context for several reasons. First of all, more than anyone else I've ever known, I am unable to talk about him ""objectively."" I know what I like and don't like about him, but it's a million miles from what others seem to think. And secondly, he is sorta the anti-NYC voice, at least insofaras I've established <em>Gossip Girl</em>'s self-involved world as that voice, which blinds and/or infuriates most of this city's denizens who are completely unable to understand his success. <br />

18267,4355,"david","http://www.davidbhayes.com/","I think your idealization or a Midwestern ""real America"" is interesting but misguided. After all, anyone in Hoboken who would actually read the article is almost certainly hoping to get to New York.<br />
<br />
As to Gawker/Manhattan's social scene, I also think it's just people's perennial obsession with celebrity writ small. While most of America spent years loving and hating Britney Spears, the Gawkersphere spent about that much time loving and hating Julia Allison. We seem to collectively love to build people up in stature if only to be able to take greater pleasure in watching them eviscerated.<br />
<br />
In some sense, I feel like the article is seeking to make that point without finding it. Emily Gould is Britney Spears on a smaller and less famous scale. There would be something interesting in such an analysis, but it's not really in the article.<br />
<br />
I'm not not your ideal of an outsider but I think there's a fair deal more egocentric navel gazing to the article (and the Gawkersphere, <a href=""http://nymag.com/relationships/sex/47055/"" target=""_blank"">this other recent article</a>, NY Observer, Young Manhattanite, etc) than many people feel is merited. But it's rather similar to the dearth of Perez Hiltons and People Magazines that exist for the rest of the country/world.<br />
<br />
Most people who have savaged the piece seem to be rejecting it as an artifact of celebrity culture--and all the petty superficiality that comes with that--than on it's merits. It is indeed a somewhat perceptive examination of what it's like to be no-privacy-allowed celebrity, even if a minor one. <br />

<br />
How New-York-centric is the media? More than New York is media-centric, bizarrely. And with that, I'm going to summon both HBO and <em>Sex And The City</em>. HBO itself is, well, a tiny part of the media landscape that gets an awfully big share of the zeitgeist. While people fight to the death over which of these three is the best television show ever (<em>The Wire</em>, <em>The Sopranos</em>, <em>Six Feet Under</em>), it must be recognized that those shows have ratings only impressive for premium TV. So, like <em>30 Rock</em> and <em>Gossip Girls</em>, these shows are highly praised and scarcely viewed. If you could buy shares in TV pilots, what would you rather have - 100 shares of <em>The Sopranos</em>, or three shares of <em>Friends?</em> Translating the same logic to SATC, this is why I'm more worried about editorial assistants and desk clerks at publishing houses than I am worried about our impressionable American youth. I simply don't think that movie is going to open big. I think that Carrie Bradshaw is the wet dream of every venal media butt-sniffer out there, and I can't find the marketability in a two-hour big screen jaunt where four women in their forties drink heavily and complain to one another. And I'm in New York! I normally enjoy vapid movies about juvenile-ish adults drinking and fucking. <br />
<br />
Indeed, this pop culture was made for your friends, but probably not for you. You're a little too smart for it. And the creators don't care. But the advertisers, oh lordy, they <em>need </em>you! Rex, you're an <em>affluencer</em>, you're <em>Generation O</em>, to steal obnoxious terms defined on the subway ads. You are the smart, trustworthy person that can really make something move if you talk about it enough. Like Kottke, who's glowing review of <em>Indiana Jones</em> today was a singular force powerful enough to make me buy a ticket and show up to the theater within half an hour of reading it. (Verdict: good!) If this country is full of 50 million groups of six people, and if one person in each group has disproportionate influence, you only need to reach 1.4 million of those people to have a $100 million opening weekend.<sup>3</sup> Or, at least that was the thinking in 1990. Now, as it turns out, one reliable blogger influences anywhere from three to one-thousand people. It has nothing to do with technical smarts, it's merely coincidental that writers, web designers, and anyone with enough time and Internet access have such power. It's coincidental that New York and Silicon Valley have a plurality of people with such power. All happy coincidences for marketers! <sup>4</sup> Food for thought.<br />
<br />
Now, about Gawker's legacy? You nailed it. Denton made enemies out of a lot of people who have no sense of humor about themselves, and employees out of the remaining twenty people in NYC. He will be the richest and most well known scumbag ever to walk down Crosby Street. Just thinking of him laughing all the way to the bank disgusts me in a very reverential sort of way, and I'm not talking about Gawker, I'm talking about the <em>first </em>company he built and sold. The reason why everyone chatters about him is, of course, to try and figure out what he's going to do next. Well, probably the same thing. Start more blogs, close down or sell the suffering ones.<sup>5</sup> I guess what I want to know is, who is the next Will Leitch or Mark Lisanti? Who's going to send Denton a good pitch and ride it to fame and professional credibility, if not great fortune?<sup>6</sup> More to the point, and this is the question that everyone is REALLY asking:<br />
<br />
<strong>How can I be that person?</strong><br />
<br />
I find that noble. I mean, it's not just a plain chase for money. Lisanti and Leitch are two of the most respectable guys out there. They work hard and have great ideas. Is it so wrong if there are people out there, in all respect and admiration, losing sleep about the fact that he/she hasn't made it there yet? Isn't that the reason why all of us are overpaying for everything, basic or frivolous, just for the privilege of being here and being able to catch a drink a couple of times a year with the gods? I mean, camaraderie is great, and there are many great fellows to be found here in NYC, but if you're asking why creative, non-braindead people are interested in Gawker, other than watching for their own name to come up, that is it. Maybe just by talking to someone who thinks on that level, successful or not, maybe an idea will roll out of someone's mouth and make someone at the table respectable and successful.<sup>7</sup> This also explains why people are interested in Julia Allison. <br />
<br />
Sadly, this does not explain the situation with Gould. She is a bad car accident and there are a lot of, um, gawkers. And she's posing suggestively in the wreckage. Quite literally.<sup>8</sup><br />

I abhor the way political discourse has moved from issues to personal attacks, and from this article, that looks like Gawker's business model.

Ignoring the essentialism of that for a moment, there's probably <em>something</em> about that which is true: Buffy and Shakespeare and The Wire and The Real World all use some of the basic story-telling devices. I guess. And interactive storytelling will probably continue to use some of these. I guess. <br />

It was a perfect storm - an interviewee who hates answering questions, an interviewer who seemingly hates asking them, and an boisterous audience who thought they were going to hear something interesting only to be disappointed. It sucked all around.<br />
<br />
It's strange to me that's a number of people defending Lacy in the blogosphere who weren't there. There is <strong>no doubt</strong> that this was a trainwreck of an interview - and it would've been as big of a train wreck at Web 2.0 or any other conference. She asked uninformed questions and she embarrassed her subject with personal stories that made him look bad. I will have a hard time taking her seriously as any sort of a journalist any time in the future.<br />

However, I do believe the that audience (including myself) <strong>was</strong> harsh. As you know, the spill over room was loud as hell - partly because we could be sure no one would hear us on stage - and we grew in strength with each perceived guffaw. In the end, it did feel like we were part of some sort of mob and I got noisy just like everyone else.

<br />
But it strikes me that it too was a reactionary style. At least you couldn't say they were copying anything like these kids are. But absent the issue of copycatting, having the right look and the right music and all must still have been terribly important back then too, and overinflated drama of youth must have ruled the day then too, which means they likely weren't the idealized noble savages we might want to retroactively paint them as having been. Were they mostly politically-aware, forward-thinking, paradigm-challenging thinkers looking to combat and defeat repression and conformity? Or were they kids just wanting to rebel against anything and be cool and get loaded?<br />
<br />
Maybe another way to examine it would be to ask what kids/people would be doing today if they were not copying punk style but were instead doing something as legitimate and original as whatever punk was underneath the mohawks. And maybe the question doesn't have to be hypothetical: Who are today's closest equivalent of the original punks? Is there any close equivalent or was it a unique cultural phenomenon native only to its era? If there are modern, non-copycat equivalents, what do they look like? What is their music?  What are their influences? What are they rebelling against in our time as distinct from or similar to what the originals rebelled against? Do they have aims and ideologies? What tired conventions and assumptions do they reject in their lifestyle?","06/25/08 00:22:26",0,"66.177.71.11"

As far as a political subculture today.... I get into this conversation a lot lately. Because I'm a reluctant optimist, I'm always searching for this, convinced that it's happening somewhere that I'm not looking.

The entire ""15 minutes of fame"" thing is becoming literally true.

I guess ordinary people have become more efficient at getting themselves on TV. That, however, is no longer a singular lifetime achievement, and it turns out to be a colossally inefficient use of one's time for almost any goal. Therefore anyone who pursues it must be deficient in some way. Ultimately the programming will be targeted to suit that audience. And so will the advertising. Eventually, advertisers will figure out that audience is a very poor target, and will stop buying ad space. Either the content will need to change, or the network will die while looking for sponsors who cater to idiots.<br />

I haven't read the <em>Cineaste</em> / <em>Film Comment</em> type stuff yet, but what I find fascinating is how it actually doesn't <em>show</em> any acts of violence until the end -- everything is implied but not seen. The camera work for this is pretty fascinating. And then, when there finally is an instance of violence... without giving it away, digital manipulation erases it. It's like there's suddenly a narrative release, but it's quickly retracted. It's all about non-satisfying satisfaction. The Lacanians will, er, eat up this shit!<br />

1) One is that this has a lot to do with the fragmentation of pop culture - i.e. to appeal to people's 'long tail tastes' you have to, as a marketer/restaurant owner whatever, use the same mentality; however, it's the same fragmentation that evacuates music of its counter-cultural potential 'cause there's never enough of a base to resist anything. Besides, even if you could get  a million people together, how in the late-capitalist ethos of ""everyone is a unique individual"", could you ever get everyone to agree? And what would you resist if you could agree? Capitalism, the very thing that gives people their individuality?<br />
2) There's something very powerful about the moment-set-to-music. If one of the reason music 'works' is because of its capacity to speak things language or images can't, then that makes sense. But I do wonder to what extent this isn't now some massive social form of branding which uses the cultural signifiers of music to create associations with products or destinations - that New York has in some weird way become a Grey's Anatomy episode.

18673,4555,"h4rbl",,"Thus.., in the writers somewhat paternalistic point of view, Europeans have a distorted view of Americans. But that view itself is distorted<br />
<br />
Nope, i think, in general, we have a really good view  of Americans and i think you most certainley do not lack the ability to distribute anything (which is a comliment tyvm). Too effective, not in my opinion, it's a representation of what you are as a nation, nothing wrong with that. It's easy to mention Mc Donalds, but there's still a whole lot of Wendy's we require and a bunch of other stuff for that matter that i can't wait to get my hands on.<br />
<br />
But, i must admit that when saying Europeans do have a representative view of Americans, i am refering to people my age in general 25+, and indeed the writer is  using students as reference (plus, he has some relativity in his article, i can read ;))<br />
<br />
I have travelled beyond Europe but there is so much more i need to see and probabely will never get to see, besides, where you or i have been is hardly relevant, since most of the time we remain anywhere, it's by far not long enough to fully understand what the people or culture at that specific place are about or the way the view things...<br />
<br />
I have worked for many years in one of the better known bars (for tourist) in the Netherlands and i have meat many, many Americans from al over your 50 states. To be true, you do have a stereotype, as do we, we are indeed somewhat more rude than most Americans. We prefer to call that ""direct"" or ""in your face/honest"", Americans on the other hand are often the somewhat exaggerated and more ""plastic"", but that can differ from place to place. We figure that is in fact lame, be honest, be upright (to the stereotype in general!)<br />
<br />
My point on your distorted view of Europeans; most Americans i meat do this Europe in X days trip. They see most Capitals and perhaps a few other cities in a matter of weeks, running from one museum to another and having a coffee in some tourist bar in between. This does not give anyone a decent view of what a culture is really like and the way ""we"" look at you. I would need at least a month in New York to at least have the slightest idea what it's people are about and the way they view things. And even then, it's just New York (same size as the netherlands regarding population!), there is a whole lot of US left besides New York as you are all aware off ;)<br />
<br />
So the Americans that do get here, don't really get to know what the people are about and the way they view things or other nations inhabitants. Th ones that don't need there info from books, foreign papers or the media.<br />
<br />
But here's the problem, since your country is so huge, there's always so much going on, plus the fact that your government is an essential part of world politics. Most of you don't get that much information about Europe (or any other region for that matter), simply because there's so much local stuff going on. There are hardly any Euro tv stations on American cable right?<br />
<br />
We on the other hand have CNN, NBC, FOX you name it, by default. Sure satellites change stuff but there's so much going on over there you don't even need to look further.<br />
<br />
American blogs are leading in the world, most Dutch blogs for example, were cheap rip offs of mostly American initiatives. And i already mentioned all other stuff that you brought, nothing wrong wit that and still not enough ;)<br />
<br />
We practically live your life when it comes to information and media, thus we have a better understanding of you than most Americans will have when regarding European people.<br />
<br />
And i apologize for calling the article dumb period, it obviously isn't dumb, since i took the time to troll around on it. And emphasizing stereotypes can be so much fun.<br />
<br />
I may be dumb, sad as that may be, but i still think you are all very cool people (even though i don't really know you) :]<br />

18684,4559,"Rex","http://www.fimoculous.com,2008-07-03 04:08:32.0","First off, I'm (sorta) pleased that you're writing in a (relatively) level-headed, reasoned manner, which is absent in so much drive-by blog commenting. Let me unpack this piece by piece...<br />
<br />
<em>My philosophy does not in fact, yield the equation you present, unless you're also saying that David Sedaris = Rex Sorgatz...</em><br />
<br />
I am David Sedaris. And so are you. And so is every Tumblr blogger.<br />
<br />
I mean this, of course, in the sense that we all share the same rights: to write in whatever style, about whatever topics. It is not an evaluative statement, a comment on aesthetics; rather, it is a comment on privilege. <br />
<br />
Your argument is that people are allowed to write in a certain way if... if they're published memoirists? Seriously, why the fuck does David Sedaris, or Augusten Burroughs, or Klosterman, or any number of lesser memoirists who make less hyperbolic examples of confession culture -- why exactly do they get to ""overshare""? Where did they get their license?<br />
<br />
And I'm a horrible example, cuz I come from a relative position of privilege, able to write my way around the ring and with an agent who wishes I produced more publishable ideas. Instead, my point here is to stick up for the people who have no interest in publishing, who simply want to write about their lives without other people yelling ""OVERSHARER!"" and ""NARCISSIST!"" at them. <br />
<br />
(I think people are going to regret that particular critique of Emily Gould too. There are legit reasons for not liking her story, but the oversharing argument isn't one of them. Again, all I can do is point you to how 20-year-olds are using Facebook. I'm not saying it's <em>good</em>; I'm saying it <em>is</em>.)<br />
<br />
Every fucking one of Klosterman's books has a story literally about <em>me</em> in it -- and all of them make me uneasy in their candor,  their overshariness. Your argument is that I need to write a book to be ""qualified"" to do the same? <br />
<br />
(I'm guessing this is where you pull back, and say your dispute with my stupid Tumblr is a matter of quality, not privilege. For the record, this was not your original point, which is why I'm ranting. From a quality perspective, was the Tumblr anything? Eh, whatever. I think it's sociological, literary... but I'll try to get to that below.)<br />
<br />
<em>You take a swipe at the cupcake and baby and mean boss tumblrs...</em><br />
<br />
I will make no enemies with the cupcake bloggers!<br />
<br />
You're just being coy now -- you know exactly what I mean. There's a kind of safe writing about safe topics that has become sanctioned online. I want everyone to write exactly what they feel like writing about -- puppies, babies, cupcakes, and their sublime adventures in adulthood. Sure! The point is that you're allowed to write about your cupcake meetup, but you're not allowed to write about your drinking/drug habits, or your dating confusion, or your angst with internet protocol. Why? Because it's too personal? My Tumblr was all anonymous!<br />
<br />
An aside: where do the sex bloggers fit in here? Oversharing par excellence!<br />
<br />
(For the record, Fimoc has never been about ANY of that personal stuff. You're gleaning this from random Twitters and a stupid Tumblr. And most of it, it seems, without context.)<br />
<br />
<em>Boo on acting as if you discovered hookup culture...</em><br />
<br />
C'mon. Yes, I DISCOVERED HOOKUP CULTURE. Jesus, is there no nuance to reading anymore? <br />
<br />
But honestly, there is ABSOLUTELY something different going on with the dating scene right now. Spend a little time reading twenty-somethings online and you'll see it. In the meantime, I'm going to unironically point you to a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/fashion/08love.html?_r=1&oref=slogin"" target=""_blank"">NYT Modern Love essay</a> that gets to it surprisingly well.<br />
<br />
<em>Whine that the commenters are winning when they call you on your shit...</em><br />
<br />
C'mon. NUANCE. You're really taking a Tweet -- ""The commenters are winning"" -- with some kind of literal quality about me? I meant that in about 10 different ways that had nothing to do with me! I didn't even necessarily mean it negatively! I'm as much part of commenter culture as anyone!<br />
<br />
(More for the record: I get very little blowback on this site in the comments. I assume this is because people just move on if they don't like this site. That's good! I think you might be my first elongated commenter dispute in years. And it's about something that isn't even really on this site.)<br />
<br />
<em>The overwhelming adolescence of it all, the mumblecore and the emo and the share-y blogs. The need for 4 tells for every kiss. The navel gazed upon so unrelentingly you burn a hole through your back. The slapping of giant orange exclamation points on drinking and making out and staying up all night, man!!!!</em><br />
<br />
I saved this part for last, because I think it's the piece where you have a legit point. This whole over-sharey, self-revelatory culture is, I confess, a recent personal fascination. But I have my reasons...<br />
<br />
It's unfair of me to typecast you, but since you're anonymous, I can create whatever identity I choose. Therefore, I'm going to guess a few other characteristics: 1) You don't ""get"" Facebook or MySpace. You think it's famewhores and untalented hacks. 2) You hate <em>The Hills</em>. 3) You hate most reality tv too. Survivor kinda depresses you because now a whole class of people want to be famous. 4) NO MORE JULIA ALLISON!!! 5) You're Lutheran.<br />
<br />
Kidding!<br />
<br />
Let's just assume that you fit the casting of the first four (don't worry -- some of my best friends hate <em>Gossip Girl</em>!). Culture and society must look pretty grim to you. And you know what? Sometimes it does to me too. But only when I let my guard down, because this whole Facebook/memoir/reality-tv/Tumblr/fake-vs-real part of society is actually the most fascinating thing in the world to me. I've completely stopped thinking about it ethically -- I exist only to understand it, from the inside. <br />
<br />
This moment we're living in -- where reality is constructed through fake newscasters, where personal details are willingly/gleefully turned into public fodder, where technology and media are clashing, where everyone wants to create their own little media empires, where the communication and publishing are becoming the same thing, where caring is creepy and casual is sexy... THIS WHAT I CARE ABOUT. And I honestly feel like there's no way to understand it, to be equipped to talk about it, unless you're in the fray, following the people on the edge, trying everything you shouldn't be trying, sticking your dick where it shouldn't belong.<br />
<br />
Fulfilling? HAH. Perhaps you really did miss the point of the Tumblr -- it really IS self-loathing, I really do sorta hate this culture. And yet.<br />
<br />
And yet, it's the most interesting thing going on in the world right now. Go ahead, laugh at that, because a great number of my friends laugh when I say it. But I mean it -- I really fucking mean it -- when I say that there's something going on in all the angst of these people, with how they deal with criticism, and lust, and the perception of themselves as seen by other people, that's completely and utterly fascinating to me.<br />
<br />
My goal is ultimately to find a medium to explain this to people. I'm clearly not there yet.<br />

And you're 100% right that I'm criticizing Fimoculous the Site for some random Tweeters and an anon Tumblr.  But, as you know and frequently advocate, the lines are blurry.  You can't be too surprised when people lose fine distinctions.  Nevertheless, you have a very good point.  My bad.<br />
<br />
Your typecasting is funny (and certainly provoked), but slightly off.  I'm actually way more into the social networking sites than I'd like.  I use my Status Updates as a poor man's Twitter, something I wish everyone did (mainly so I don't have to join Twitter). I think all those social applications are great, and although fraught with obvious pitfalls, are a great way to keep up on people that you wouldn't necessarily want to call up on the phone.  <br />

<br />
Sex bloggers: yuck, yawn.  Don't care for them, but whatever gets you through the night, folks.  Don't like most reality TV, you're right, but mainly b/c I work in Film/TV and I think the format has always been so lazy and predictable.  Except Pick Up Artist, of course.  That shit was great.  <br />
<br />
The truest thing I ever read about the new culture is that exhibitionism is the new generation gap.  And it is.  I don't get it, I don't like it -but it's not up to me.  My complaint <em>would</em> be that all this Me-ism would take away from engagement in the larger world, but this group seems WAY more involved in issues than my Gen X slacker crew ever was.  Though 8 years of Bush would make anyone pop up and pay attention, I'd guess.  <br />

The way it's phrased, it would seem folly to disagree. But I would, in this sense: a lot of what gets called ""exhibitionism"" won't be in the future -- it will be just called sharing.

Helms was particularly vitriolic when speaking of gays and lesbians, blaming them for ""the proliferation of AIDS,"" and stating that he disliked using the word ""gay"" to refer to them since, ""...there's nothing gay about them.""<br />
<br />
Helms opposed the Martin Luther King Day bill in 1983 on grounds that King had two associates with communist ties, Stanley Levison and Jack O'Dell; as well, he voiced disapproval of King's alleged philandering.<br />
<br />
Helms' referred to the University of North Carolina (UNC) as the ""University of Negroes and Communists."" (Charleston Gazette, 9/15/95)<br />
<br />
While working on the 1950 campaign of Republican Willis Smith against Democrat Frank Porter Graham, Helms helped create an ad that read ""White people, wake up before it is too late. Do you want Negroes working beside you, your wife and your daughters, in your mills and factories? Frank Graham favors mingling of the races."" Another ad featured photographs Helms himself had doctored to illustrate the allegation that Graham's wife had danced with a black man.(FAIR 9/1/01, The News and Observer 8/26/01)<br />
<br />
Helms was an ardent supporter of the late brutal Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.<br />
<br />
When Roberta Achtenberg was appointed Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, Helms attempted to block her confirmation, stating that he refused to vote for ""that damned lesbian"".<br />
<br />
After a protest during his 1986 visit to Mexico, Helms opined: ""All Latins are volatile people. Hence, I was not surprised at the volatile reaction.""<br />
<br />
Helms once claimed that ""The New York Times and Washington Post are both infested with homosexuals themselves. Just about every person down there is a homosexual or lesbian."" <br />

I liked the word ""oversharing"" when Emily used it, but less than two weeks later and I never want to hear it again.<br />
<br />
What's the difference between oversharing and just sharing?  Your personal emo threshold?<br />
<br />
Art is oversharing.  I would daresay there is no art without it.<br />
<br />
With a novel or a sculpture or a painting, the sharing between you and the artist is filtered by publishers, distance, and the conventions of the medium.<br />
<br />
But the internet has made art cheap, and by the same token it has made emotion cheap.  The emotional connection that occurs between a reader and a novelist is perceived as precious because it's just one way.<br />
<br />
But when you can touch the artist, when you can say ""thank you"" and get a ""you're welcome"" back in your inbox -- when you're overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of the sharing -- the unedited raw blobs of emotion...<br />
<br />
I think the people who complain about oversharing are just snobs.  They want their art filtered, processed, sanitized and read-only.<br />
<br />
They don't object to emotion per se, they just want it managed and packaged for them.<br />

After all, Gould's decision to 'become more private' had to be rendered publicly for it to become real. And I'd guess that part of that has to do with the persistence of online identities - that, somewhat akin to an author's words, they exist even when you're not there. So one's online persona becomes like a reference point on a map that you orient yourself in relation to and unlike a book, it quite literally exists 'out there' in the public sphere rather than being tied to a physical object. And I guess that's why I think this quote is off when it calls the dissolution of the boundaries between public and private 'unsurprising'. It's very surprising, because it represents a constant reconfiguration of 'private identity' in relation to a public object, in a manner that was not possible when 'the public' could not be located on a screen. If Derrida is the proto-Web-theorist then his sense of identity and language as always flickering between presence and absence would seem to be useful here.<br />

On the subject of SXSW (and when did we ever really leave it?), Amy pointed out that we could make a killing as backing musicians   we just book ourselves into a decent hotel early in the game and then get on to all the solo artists we know that might need a band, let them know that they'll be there and offer our services. Get yourself an all-star backing group - next year Amy and I will be there, me with guitar and bass, Amy with guitar and keyboards, both of us in superb voice, ready to tackle those difficult harmonies, and hot to trot at a mere $100 dollars a pop. Each.<br />
I'm going to be one of those pain in the arse people rushing for show to show with an armful of instruments, ever self-important and always looking beyond you for more interesting possibilities when you try to engage me in conversation. And I think I'll take up a sideline as well, just so that I can watch the poor suckers that engage our services inwardly groan when I announce that I've brought the old mandolin along - thought it might come in handy'&<br />
Understand, I'm not knocking the musos, I sometimes wish I was one. Musicians complain about everything but at least they sometimes get paid. But musicians quite often assume that the star of the show, people like me and Amy, are making loads of money while they're earning a pittance. We've found that by not having any other musicians in our group we can indeed earn a pittance  and sometimes we almost earn enough to live on.<br />
But this lack of musicianly help has meant that our album has taken an extraordinary amount of time because we've been doing everything ourselves. But this has also meant that Amy has learned to play the piano, my bass playing has improved three thousand fold (whatever fold means), we've developed tremendous percussion skills and we can spot a viable sounding loop in the day to day operational noise of any domestic appliance or gadget. Actually that last bit is a slight exaggeration  we've never recorded the salad spin - but I do have an almost cosmic sample culled from a recording of the toilet flushing in my old flat in Brighton.<br />
And I didn't get a musician to flush it  I flushed it myself and operated the sampler with the other hand (which of course I washed afterwards).","05/30/08 15:27:24",0,"64.81.162.175"

But i'm quite sure that's not what you yankees are after. Sure, you guys have developed some properties over time that may look like some sort of culture, when hamburgers or food are taken into account ;-P<br />
You have decently managed to completely fuck over the lovely British language you inhereted. That's raping culture not cultivating it ;)<br />
Further something that is truely all American is hiphop or rapmusic and the gang-related scene alongside, unique in the world, since music really is a part of a nations culture. The positiver aspect of course is jazz music, even though that is a mixture of African and European styles. Still just history, not culture, perhaps it wil be in due time.<br />
<br />
We Euros have imperialised the world for ages and ages. That's something you have only started doing the last 100 years or so, luckily you're catching up fast and have taken (economical) imperialism to a higher level <br />
<br />
But in arts, architecture, science, filosophy, fashion, writing, politics and even sports, you guys have a history but surely lack any form of real culture. Something you can't help since your republic (lol) is not even 250 years old. And please don't give me ""we have culture but lack the ability to distribute it"". Culture grows over ages, and since you lack ages, it couldn't have grown ;)<br />
Further i must mention that it sickenend me when i read ""that the United States is as good at manufacturing culture as the rest of the world combined"". Only an American can write, think or say something as uber narcissistic as that.<br />
<br />
Understand that culture is NOT something you manufacture, and if it were, the Chinese would beat you at it. But then, they actually have a very rich culture.<br />
If there's anything you ARE actually good at it's the ability to distribute your brainless way of living and anything that comes with it. <br />
<br />
Taking East Germany's ""opinion"" is hardly representative for the rest of the European union. Don't forget this was a soviet state not too long ago and you were shot when trying to leave it ( not even 20 years ago!) and they have some catching up to do ;)<br />
<br />

Further i must mention that it's rather weak or lame to only respond to the ""smiley"", and not to the content of my comment. <br />

It's the writer of the article that wants to find out how European people think about American people, and at the end draws the conclusion that ""Euros"" appearantly have a somewhat distorted view of Americans.<br />
<br />
Personally i know quit a few Americans, from all over your lovely country, most Americans are prolly ok, decent intelligent people. But there are many, many Americans that don't look any further than there own silly country. Give a Yank a world map and ask him some topographic questions and you'll get my point.<br />
<br />
Most Europeans know a whole lot more about YOUR history than a whole lot of Americans. Most Euros speak your language (beter than you do). Care to reply on this in Dutch? Nah, i didn't think so ;) <-- p.a.g.<br />
<br />
There's no hate for Americans whatsoever, though i wouldn't mind whooping your ""presidents"" redneck ass. Or should i say thief of democracy?<br />
<br />
The article is utterly stupid, the claim that Americans probabely have more culture than most countries together is too silly too mention. The statement that Americans are louzy in distributing there ""stuff"" is too foolish for words as i point out in my last sentence.<br />
The articel itself and the view of the writer are plain dumb period.<br />
<br />
I am a Euro and give my opinion, that's what the silly article is all about isn't it? Sure, i could have left the style as is, but it's just plain fun going us vs them, just like at the office where you have fans of one sportsteam and fans of another working together but verbally attacking the other fans team.<br />

h4rbl, considering your comments, the only writer being just plain dumb (or to use your words, ""decent intelligent"") has to be you.<br />
Do you think you're doing any European a favour with that?<br />
<br />
BTW, did you even read the whole article? Because you're totally missing the point.<br />
<br />
I wonder if you ever eventually managed to move your ass out of Europe. Judging from your really differentiated insights, i guess not. Its just pathetic.<br />
<br />
Regarding the article, i thought it was very insightful. Corresponding to many experiences i had in discussions with Europeans about America and its culture.<br />
I especially agree with the authors statement about distributing american culture. Because it literally is everywhere. Even in China - how about going there ""grown-up"" h4rbl, and see for yourself. For example, try counting the McDonalds subsidiaries in Shanghai. And that would be only one and very obvious example..<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the article excellently proves the problematic view that many Europeans share about America. Actually the younger generations (students) are significantly affected, as the article shows. When America (and its culture) is the issue, more often than not, stereotypes are the predominant ""opinion"".<br />

<br />
@ Kitty<br />
<br />
You didn't get my point regarding the gun thing, we appearantly DONOT all think you are crazy gunslingers, in fact the intention that is behind your law can only be considered a good thing. I blame you guys (which is lame, i confess, trust me, i understand) for not using the weapons you are entitled to in the way your founding fathers intended them to be used. I am pointing out that Europeans in general have a lot of knowledge about your country and your history, you are a part of us plus world leading, so in fact we have to. I honestly do think that ""our"" knowledge of your history is larger than you knowledge of ours, whitout any judgement, i do think that's a pitty<br />
<br />
If you read through the exaggeration, i am saying Americans have history which will be culture in due time, and of course that's already culture, duh. I am merely saying it's comparing apples and bananas, this due to the time Europe and China for that matter had to grow culture. It's easy and lame to refer to hamburgers as being culture, i only thought and perhaps hoped that visitors of this blog would take that as a natural thing. Words used to debunk that are wasted, simply because it's a dumb statement, but fun to say once in a while (like when i say your pitcher sucks, he is still in no1 team isn't he?) As is the language remark for that matter, it's a lot easier to write night iso nite ;)<br />
<br />
@ Gus<br />
""No thanks, and I'm sure most Euros wouldn't either""<br />
<br />
Well, French, German or Spanish? Nah, seriously, i can't argue with any of your points simply because they're so true. Except for the last one regarding Lisabon, because there your missing the point, which gets me to my point.<br />
<br />
American perception of European people in general is not representative, i am doing exactly what you expect from Euros :] The writer mentions it's our view that is somewhat distorted while i think it's just the opposite, which i will argue in a minute.<br />
<br />
Kittyholmes' remark of Bush, Baywatch and McGyver prove my point.<br />
<br />
Of course i understand that the whole of Europe doesn't even cover the land of the US, it is therefore a logical thing that we speak more languages than most Americans (when viewed in percentage!), simply because we need to communicate. as do you without the need to learn additional languages (k perhaps spanish)<br />
And i won't fool myself as i am well aware of the fact that Euro governments are equally territorial and nationalistic as Americans are. Guess we even invented it (i did say most of your culture is a derivation of European culture, which can't be argued because most Americans have some Euro background). Especially the dutch with Shell..., our Royal family always had good relations with American intelligence, in fact, our prince Bernard is considered one of the founders of Bilderberg and helped consolidate nazi science after ww2 for use within USA Intelligence. Our government is like Pinokio in Guiseppes (Bush's) hand. But Bush, Obama or McCain for that matter, most things prolly won't change, even though i would prefer Obama, Ron Paul made some sence to btw.<br />
<br />
Regarding the Lisboa treaty, that has really nothing to do with European pride. It's about a constitution that was rejected by some countries due to fascistic properties (France, Netherlands, Denmark), which is being implemented in another way, being the Lisboa treaty. This way they tried to keep the new constitution from being subject to the peoples vote in referenda. Sadly (for them) Ireland has a somewhat different view of changing the values arranged in there constitution and there it still required a referendum. And trust me that i am one happy sob because of what the Irish did.<br />
Thank you Ireland!<br />
<br />
And indeed, even though i wish i had done so prevously, i haven't been to the US yet. And because of the your laws for immigrants i most likely won't in the very near future. My business is not your governments business.<br />

But it's also pretty clear that they got good and drunk, stepped up to the mic, and made a bunch of jokes that were poorly understood. They didn't really care about the repercussions, or cared only as much as a jaded teenager might. I attribute that to immaturity, and not some sort of innate evil or hostility against feminism. But since even the girls are dismissive of their own comments, it's pretty obvious that we should be dismissive, too.<br />
<br />
Denton's role in this is that this is his modus operandi. Denton did not tell them to visit a comedy show and act like jackasses, but I don't find this incident inconsistent with their roles on Jezebel. And where does the Jezebel buck stop? Denton has a tradition of hiring low-rate writers who mimic his own sensibilities (and he is known to not care who he offends or degrades). His investment and marketing resources empower the bloggers in his employ, so that their message reaches a significant audience. And, as the hands-on leader of a publishing company, his role is essentially executive editor. The girls at Jezebel enjoy much more autonomy than the Gawker.com bloggers, of course, but even so, what do you think his reaction is to this brouhaha? He hasn't rebuked their behavior publicly, even as he knows quite well that these girls were representing the Jezebel brand. (Anna at Jezebel indeed scolded them privately for misrepresenting the website) If we're talking NYMag and Adam Moss here, they'd both be out of a job. So, I do think the girls were irresponsible, and Denton pretty much pays them to be that way on a daily basis, and this is the fruit of that arrangement. If there were any accountability here, there would have been a formal apology more substantial than ""we know we fucked up, so I got drunk enough afterward to forget it.""","07/07/08 15:27:44",0,"66.65.95.186"

<br />
Well, Rex was seemingly disappointed with my reaction, which in part accused the girls of being childish, and also put some of the blame on Denton (briefly, for sloppily encouraging this as an editor).<br />
<br />
I won't rehash that but I do have an update. <a href=""http://jezebel.com/5023064/remember-when-your-dad-embarrassed-you"" target=""_blank"">Moe seems to have responded here</a>. (Tracie's response was to get drunk, blog about the incident, and then blog about getting drunk.) Her reaction is deeply sincere, but so weird that I'm still only 80% sure that she's responding to her stage incident and not to something else.<br />
<br />
I understand that it's perhaps bothersome (and hypocritical?) for one blogger to call another ""childish"" and I'm sorry if that rubs anyone the wrong way. I am not dismissive of her overall. I think that Moe's reaction post contains better clues that illuminate the issue.<br />
<br />
She is obviously very smart, so she makes good points frequently. She has impressively developed ideas. Her words should not be dismissed out of hand for any reason.<br />
<br />
Still, if the link above is indeed a reaction to the ""Shoot the Messenger"" debacle, it's not as much contrite as it is insistently self-deprecating. She's using the Popeye defense. ""I yam what I yam."" That serves to close the door on discussion, understanding and change, which is a very bad thing for people who aspire to be learned and conversational. Like, um, a pro columnist! It's also ego-centrism, in which might compete but she'll never beat my high score.<br />
<br />
Besides, what is she self-excusing anyway? Her real opinions, her manner of expressing them, an evening of ill-timed jokes? ""<em>I'm sorry for... doing... stuff.</em>"" (That's the Giambi Defense)<br />
<br />
I've realized in life that it is difficult to interact with people who use self-deprecation and sloppy excuses to justify any behavior. That's actually a huge interpersonal frustration of mine in the year 2008, so to recognize it strikes a chord in me. It is, in a word, <em>immaturity</em>.<br />
<br />
It's also worth noting that it's the second time in a month that <a href=""http://gawker.com/tag/the-internets/?i=395788&amp;t=why-does-the-internet-make-us-such-horrible-people"" target=""_blank"">she's done a public appearance while drinking.</a> I won't judge her drinking habits, but I find this concerning. What, she's borrowing Dean Martin's act? If she wants to be more Gloria Steinem than Krusty the Clown, she should aim for her best composure when on-stage. It shows respect for the audience.<br />
<br />
Which brings us to this: she has an audience that deserves respect. No amount of Charles Barkley-like ""I ain't your hero, kid"" grumbling or Popeye regrets is going to change the fact that her audience exists and can either be fed or abused. I sincerely hope she makes considerate decisions in this regard. There's a lot of pressure that comes with a large audience, but she certainly has the potential to deliver for them.<br />
<br />

@ Ms. Pants, the comedy show dodge really doesn't shed that much light, any more than it excused Michael Richards (not that this on that level) or any random idiot on Politically Incorrect who spouts offensive things.  Outside of Mo's po' man's Sarah Silverman act, it was clear they were stating their real opinions on rape, etc.  Those opinions happened to be offensively dismissive, so they should grow up and take the heat.  <br />
<br />
But instead, Tracie reacted like a Columbia freshman and got plastered (er, more so) and made out with a boy people warned her about, and Moe followed a circuitous and cowardly path of blame back to her father somehow.  Same hole, only deeper dug.<br />

@ Rex, blogging is a medium, not a genre.  The performance side is only one branch of the tree,  and one that it's becoming clear a lot of people are getting bored with.

<br />
There's this recent phenomenon (separate from the internet) in American popular culture to hyperbolically misrepresent/overstate even the mildest criticism.  People aren't mocked or critiqued, they're ""crucified"" or ""thrown under the bus"" by ""hatas"" who are only jealous of their success.

Some people say some stupid stuff on an otherwise almost invisible show and it spreads like fire and becomes a huge issue that people get really involved in, spend lots of time on, fight about, write articles about, etc.  I know that it doesn't matter, because I can turn off the computer and it evaporates as though it never happened. It has no effect on anything and will be forgotten. It exists only as its echoes. <br />
<br />
But I'm interested in why and how it becomes something that people feel the need to get invested in, even passionately. I'm not saying they shouldn't, I'm just trying to figure out why they do. It's something new. There's something about this here internet.<br />
<br />
It's like the internet is the inside of someone's mind. All the shit you think about but never say is said here. All the thoughts that are too little to be converted into words in normal life come out on the internet. Why? The nasty stuff too. You wouldn't call someone piece of shit to their face if you thought they were one, but you'd do it on the internet. It's like the keyboard removes a filter that otherwise governs objectionable or microscopically uninportant things. <br />
<br />
I'm very interested in how this will change us as a species because I don't think it's something that will just pass and fade. It will only increase, this connectedness and always-on-ness and everybody being aware of everybody else's everything and responding to it as though it's part of the thoughts that run around in your own head all the time. Over enough time it will redefine conscious life as a collective experience, albeit electronically induced. I thought Cory Doctorow's book Down And Out In The Magic Kingdom was gut-churning with all the Disneyland crap, but the internet brains thing seems like where we're headed. That points system they had, where you immediately check someone's status and get their details when you encounter them is pretty much what the google-somebody reflex is already, and now possible via wireless mobiles, expanded further by blogs and twitter.<br />

<br />
JA is so complicated. I've talked elsewhere about this idea:<br />
<br />
Several years ago, when I was living in Minneapolis, I started a <a href=""http://www.mnspeak.com/"">website</a> that was basically a local version of Metafilter (plus a few other things -- but conversation + links was the main part). It was around the time that Diablo Cody was starting to get big. The resentment, the backlash, the bombast in Minneapolis was bigger than anywhere else. As she got bigger, the good people in Minneapolis hated her more.<br />
<br />
I couldn't figure it out then, but now I start to understand it. And I think it's a little bit like Julia/Gawker. These new kinds of internet celebs are so open, so available, so easy to chat-up at a party or in IM... they're completely different than Big Fame, and yet they're part of it. (Seriously, we can't deny this any more -- Julia is on the cover of <em>Wired</em> and Diablo has an Oscar. They're big.) But it's actually their accessibility, their similarity to us that makes them such lightning rods. Diablo's closeness, like Julia's, makes her more contemptible.<br />
<br />
It's more complex than this ""jealousy"" answer... but I really think that's a big part of it. Sometimes I'll try to tell the biggest JA haters that they are actually the closest to her, and those who ignore her are the furthest. This inevitably leads to an argument.<br />

Forgetting your connection to Ford for a moment and the specific incident of her blogging about him and the issues surrounding that, why does it bother us that she has gotten visibility and that it's probably her looks that did it? We could as well ask it about Paris Hilton and substitute money for looks. Everybody felt a visceral disgust for Hilton because she was getting the spotlight but hadn't done anything. And we still couldn't look away from stories about her. Do we want the spotlight ourselves? What value do we place on the spotlight? Is it the attention? People's admiration? What do we crave, that these people are getting, that puts us out of sorts because they are getting it? What does it mean to deserve the spotlight? I don't want to be famous but I still get these negative feelings for people. Por qua? Am I bitter that I'm not rich and better looking? Why do you, for example, feel it's important for JA's status as a nobody to be known and hopefully restored? Because I think you'd feel relieved and satisfied if she was dethroned and had to get an office job and stopped posting pictures of herself online, right? How is her current elevated/visible status hurting or otherwise affecting you? I asked the same question of myself but couldn't come up with the answer.

Maybe this is because we fill in all the holes with what we imagine must be great stuff. And internet celebs are the opposite of inaccessible.

actually though i am fond of the musical episode, it's kind of an episode for people in the know, and it's a terrible episode to watch if you haven't seen buffy before, which a few of my friends have made the mistake of doing. then i have to coax them back...with season 1. the lamest season of all. <br />
<br />
my top three favorite episodes (minus the bits with buffy and spike in season 6, rrrowr.) are doppelgangland, (evil vampire willow from ""the wish"" crosses over.) something blue, (where all of willow's wishes accidentally come true,) and the zeppo. (xander saves the world, sleeps with faith, and nobody knows.) all of these episodes are quoted quite often by me.<br />
<br />
and if i haven't given myself away yet, (NERD!) a friend and i went to see james marster's (spike) band a few years ago, and it was awesome. the whole audience was 45 year old suburban moms in cat sweaters and goth kids who were exactly like the vampire cult from season 2 and tended to yell ""spike!"" at the stage a lot. <br />

I despise the fact that people worship individuals who lack grace, talent, intelligence, or reasonable emotions - as long as they are pretty and well-dressed. Society is obsessed with these people, for the similarly dreadful motives of golden-idol worship and exploitation. I don't like being reminded of this fact. <br />
<br />
But it's not all terrible. I see Audrina as an rube-like innocent and an accidental aristocrat, who got unwittingly tangled up in this mess but seems to handle it with more class than people give her credit for. Compared to Heidi/Spencer (most venal couple ever) or Lauren (the least pleasant person of the 21st Century so far), Audrina comes off like Jackie O. (Also, nice tits.) That is one kind opinion I have about this universe. <br />
<br />
That said, I get my New LA from <em>Entourage</em>, where everyone is 70% fictitious and not 10% like <em>The Hills</em>. When it comes to whimsical sitcoms imitating real life, I don't like my peas in my mashed potatoes. <br />
<br />
It would also help if they weren't all dull and slow-witted. My ideal reality show would follow around someone clever talking to various other clever people about random culture topics, avoiding the crutch of trying to extract plotlines from mismanaged personal relationships or fanciful celebrity travels. Those wells are pretty much dry. In particular, the drama cycle in that group is like <em>1984</em>. ""Eurasia is a bitch!"" ""Eastasia is a bitch!"" ""Eurasia is a bitch!""

It's funny because they're all nice, funny, lovable losers, lucky to be friends with the incredibly fortunate actor dude. They're always cracking  jokes but also variously getting themselves in jams or trying to accomplish things on their own (and usually failing or not getting much done). Even for their faults, they're not jerks. (Ari Gold is a jerk, but he's a hysterical character and a mesmerizing heel) There is lots of charm in that show from the characters. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't say <em>The Hills</em> encourages <strong>worship</strong> of the damned, rather to clarify my earlier statement, it is focused on people who are also losers and/or barely talented. It's just that it's not a comedy. I suppose you're supposed to feel tension when Lauren fights with her roommates or friends. Instead, I just think she's nasty and frustrating to watch. She's not charming at all. No one on the show is. These are not people I'd ever invite to a party, except for Audrina. That is my opinion of these real life individuals, something that cannot be dismissed by saying that I don't like the scripts or the directing or the character arcs.

<br />
I suspect if you were cruising down a well known hooker alley and you stopped and said to a woman who you presumed to be a hooker, but was actually a police pose, ""hey, how about $100 for sex?,"" you would be arrest. In the same situation, if you said, ""hey, I'll give you $100 to star in an adult film I'm making,"" you probably wouldn't be arrested.<br />
<br />
It's very screwy, as are many laws related to sex, but I think that is the core difference: paying ofr acting versus paying for sex.<br />
<br />
Tangentially, I was talking to a family friend who is a criminal lawyer not all that long ago, and he told me about a case he had: a man in his twenties was married (legally) to a 16 year old. However, he was arrested and convicted on child porn charges for naked photos (which apparently weren't sexual in nature, just nude) he'd taken of his wife. He's now in prison. It was legal for him to marry her, legal for him to have sex with her, but not legal for him to photograph her nude. So f'ed up.","07/24/08 16:19:19",0,"72.129.169.246"

This bit may be tangential, but the way in which the camera changes things is also interesting in terms of what you called 'turning the private into public fodder'. If, as I've been arguing, 'the online' constituted a new, reconfigured public space, then the gaze - the idea that an audience is always-already out there waiting for you - seems to change social dynamics. I was sitting in a bar yesterday, having a great time and felt the need to to twitter it. That's fucking weird. But it was like I was making it more real and more significant by making it a public text. But this sorta' relates to what you were saying about the camera validating everything - to make something public, to perform it is to legitimise it. I'd bring up Gould again, but I'm sorta' sick of it.<br />

Essentially you have a group of people who are on a reality show and because of the fame from that show they are involved in all sorts of things, some of which would actually be interesting to see them deal with. But for some reason the producers decided to freeze their lives to where it was in the first season, instead of exploring their new, on-the-show lives. It creates this weird reality where you can read in US Weekly or People about LC getting her own clothing line or Audrina being on a movie and yet in the show LC's still and intern and Audrina a receptionist. <br />

The author uses ""we"" as though he is of that generation, but he writes as though he's from an older one.  ""These kids today - nothing but wastrels! In my day we did it right."" It's a conundrum because you kind of have to be out of it to view it objectively but if you're out of it you can't help but speak about it with a bit of biased hell-in-a-handbasket tone. I've been hearing it in myself for a while.<br />
<br />
I will agree with him partially by lamenting the accelerated recycling of past decades instead of creating new ones. As happy as I am that 80's synthesizers are everywhere again, for example, (why did we ever stop using them, really?), it seems lazy. I suppose reggaeton shows that you can come up with new and defining sounds for a time period (okay that's a smallish example), but the recycling seems to overshadow things like that. I was disappointed that the 90's recycled the 70s too soon. Flared jeans started coming back, and those awful, muted brown/orange/yellow color combinations of my very early childhood took root again and have only faded recently.  And the horrible 70's guy hair started up again sometime late 90s maybe and bled over to this decade. I can't breathe when I see those horrid mops that look like someone tried their hardest to look their worst and then slept on it. And then the girls were all about the 80s hair until recently. I think if you want to recycle a decade, there ought to be a mandatory waiting period - 30 years minimum, and preferably 40. Hey... was the 80s the 50s? That jeans and Gap tee look... Anyway, it doesn't seem like the 90s had a real definition of its own, and maybe we have to get out of this one before we can see it for whatever it is. So at least in terms of fashion and some elements of pop culture I can agree with the author's lamentations partially. But calling it the end is the same old shortsighted mistake, as though the scene will still be hipstery 20 years from now with no end in sight, skinny jeans everywhere. Just because you can't picture the future doesn't mean it won't come and be different. They can write the same article, say, 14-17 years from now and just swap out some key words.","07/30/08 21:20:02",0,"69.180.95.131"

Tumblr has a great reblog mechanism that is actually more difficult to circumvent than to just lazily use, unless you are pathologically selfish or pathologically design-oriented (a ""reblogged"" post is a little untidy compared to a clean-slate post). It's to be considered in the debate. It is definitely possible that more people are not being attribution-friendly even when the whole thing is designed to be overly-attributive. I am not taking surveys on this.<br />
<br />
Gawker, it seems, went from attributing zero posts to Tumblrers to attributing a few, when possible (and sometimes inconveniently for them). Credit where it's due. Also, sometimes in this age of ""that should have been posted 5 minutes ago"", it is nearly impossible to be thorough with any part of the process.<br />
<br />
And remember, the only reason why anyone would want attribution on a blog meme in the first place is basically to have more sex. The type of person who purposely seeds blog memes must be the type of person not getting enough satisfaction / girl reaction. Or vice versa. ""Hey, guys, I started the Montauk Monster!""

i think the attribution on gawkah (its more fun when you misspell it!) and elsewhere (to tumblr, or whatever) is not trend worthy -- there are just more people self-publishing (and over-sharing, if you want to go all the way with this) so there's bound to be some frustration amidst all this traffic, though it will surely wane when re-blogs are no longer considered cool points (please, karp/someone fix this).<br />

<br />
Your point is that attribution should occur when... when you're getting paid for it?  Or wait... never? Because you're not ""really"" ""reporting""?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure where to start there. But I seem to know another class of inviduals who deride a certain subset of the media machine for not actually doing any reporting and leaching off the system: It's what reporters say about Gawker.<br />
<br />
And to be clear, I don't think Gawker is <em>that bad</em> at attribution. They do it sometimes. But Tumblrs (to generlize) are really bad at it, especially when the link comes from outside of Tumblr.<br />

1.) Getting to the URL isn't easy sometimes. If the link actually runs a script that pops up a new window, then I don't want to waste my time finding out the URL. <br />
<br />
2.) SEO. I figure good stories (ones worth linking to!) deserve to have their main article page indexed and ranked higher in Google for others to find. Most people will link to this page, not the printer-friendly version. Might as well follow the crowd.<br />
<br />
3.) Supporting the site's ads. I hate web ads, but I realize that pageviews matter and supports the people who write/create these wonderful articles I link to. I figured if someone really is annoyed by ads, they'd have downloaded Firefox and installed AdBlock by now. <br />

<br />
These are huge. The time it takes to start downloading a torrent that's 480p or better may take more time than all the commercials combined in a Hulu movie. Then, of course, you have to actually download the movie, which can take anywhere between 30 minutes (if you're extremely lucky) to a few days. I don't want to spend the time/energy to torrent a movie and then watch it. I'd much rather chuck a couple bucks into iTunes or deal with the Hulu commercials and instantly start watching.<br />
<br />
There's also consistency. I've downloaded a torrent movie that took forever, only to find out that the audio compression rendered the movie unwatchable. This will never be an issue on Hulu.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the final plus is not having to worry about any MPAA legality issues (I know there are workarounds, but this is just another layer of time wasted, in my opinion, and time is money all the same).","08/16/08 10:48:55",0,"24.12.71.100"

<br />
Anyway, I watched Groundhog day on Hulu and poked around the list of available movies. The video quality not great (it's sort of subtly jerky) but certainly watchable. The commercials are irritating but will probably be less so if they attract more advertisers and get some variety going. The selection is the interesting thing, though -- it's mostly crap. You and Kottke found literally everything interesting on the list. This suggests that the distributors are using this mainly as an experiment, and that I think is cause for celebration.<br />
<br />
I also checked out Netflix's watch on demand service, which was interesting. After an irritating startup (What, I have to use internet explorer?! WHAT, I have to download software AND update Media Player??) the quality actually was pretty good. UNTIL, a few minutes in, it told me it needed to recalibrate my internet connection, and sit back and wait for ""22 minutes."" Needless to say they have some kinks to work out there.<br />
<br />
Stephen~<br />
<br />
So what you're saying is ""Hulu is great when you want to watch something _right now_ and you don't mind it being crap."" I guess I agree with that. There are maybe three more movies on there I won't mind seeing, but after that I dunno. Hopefully they'll keep adding content.","08/16/08 15:16:15",0,"69.84.99.33"

Matt wrote a post expressing his anxiety about the sense of community he once felt, and the tension he feels now. And you: ""I know y'all invented the Internet and commenting"" -- ya gotta be a dick about everything? Really?<br />
<br />
On the Julia/microfame stuff... what? I have no idea what you're talking about. Did commenters/Gawker create Julia? Yes. Did I have anything to do with that? Hah! You have much more to do with that than me! I wrote an article, the purpose of which was to expose some hubris in internet culture. Perhaps it was too subtle.<br />
<br />
@Eric: I hear this a lot. I hear people say ""no, it's always been like this."" And those people usually cite Listservs. They're right! Stupid flame wars were always part of internet culture. (I have flame threads going back to 1992 on alt.whatever.whatever too.) ""Part of"" is what has changed. Just because it existed before doesn't mean it was pervasive. It overlooks two specific things: 1) places that were once a refuge and 2) the sanctity of personal space.<br />
<br />
Like walking into certain bars, when you entered a Listserv, you knew what you were getting into. But starting a personal site, or entering a small community site, used to carry different expectations. You expected more civil rules. You expected some amount of decorum. It wasn't that you wanted all bars to be clean; it's that you didn't want them all to be dirty in the exact same way.<br />
<br />
And that's my problem: all of the internet is becoming exactly the same.<br />
<br />
This site, and most other personal sites, is proof. Fimoc is now treated like everyone's personal Listserv. It's why people like Kottke have given up and turned off comments, and it's why if this site grows any bigger, I'll have to turn off comments too. There's a point where conversation with people I respect turns into drive-by noise that needs to be contended with, none of which is constructive, helpful, or interesting.<br />
<br />
@krucoff: No, it's not just magnitude, it's geography. It's pervasive in a way it never was before. I wake up now looking around for random shitty, mean, stupid things people say, which are framed in little locked boxes that can't be responded to. (Should I write you an email for every fucking stupid, inacurate, mean thing your site says? Or should I just ignore it? It's a perfect world you've created -- there's no right answer to that. You know that everyone has to just live with it because that's what you do. And you LIKE THIS.) <br />
<br />
In your world, this is entertaining, fun -- The Way It Should Be. You want everyone to live in this freefall space where an eternal state of The Roast is in effect. You want everyone on guard, ready to take a hit, and ready to give one back. This is FUN to you. In my world, and in most other people's on the internet, it's a lack of progress. There is ZERO conversation in this environment. No one advances, no one learns. We're left to founder in a space of pure attitude and image.<br />
<br />
The worst part is now everyone EXPECTS the same thing out of the internet. All sites have comments, all of them are full of people saying bullshit about other people. Commenter society has gone from a) fringe to b) common to c) necessary to d) demanded. If your site doesn't have asshole characters on it, IT SHOULD. Disagree? You're HUMORLESS. <br />
<br />
@Lupu: I don't know what you're calling ""left-leaning,"" but I'm sure you can say whatever you want on those sites as long as you're not being a complete dickhead.<br />

Krucoff leaves a dismissive comment saying 'link blogging won't change anything'- which (maybe?) misses the fact that the conversation in the comments is what counts, not the list of links. As for the exhortation to go out and volunteer, that seems off to me - why the assumption that you can only do one or the other, or that ideas/words etc. have no effect. Saying 'all this is a distraction' sounds vaguely like someone in the 14th cent. saying 'these printed books are nice an' all, but real knowledge comes from the mouth'. <br />
<br />
Fek leaves a vaguely asshole-ish comment that derides anyone who ""has a problem with anything other than sincerity and 'civil' conversastion"", thereby setting up the need for a similarly snarky response. Why are we supposed to be aiming for NYC-style shoutfests?

I wasn't trying to be assholish at all, but take from it what you will, <em>as people on the internet are wont to do</em>. <br />

The bilateralism you describe above is elitist posturing - the idea that there's mutuality and then there's everything else. Personally, I think the idea of mutuality is great in (utopian) theory but in practice, is often times total bullshit. Go to the theater, watch a play, and the most common takeaway is that most conversations that people have are loaded with things like power dynamics, competition, and the need for one to be heard...without actually connecting with anybody else one is speaking with (I've seen Rex be this dismissive <em>in person, at a bar</em>, let alone on the internet).<br />

19610,4968,"Rex","http://www.fimoculous.com","@krucoff It's a good point about technology and history. But I think it misses the mark on what people are saying. It's not that anyone is looking at YouTube (or at Gawker or at whatever) and screaming about the kids today. Most of these people ignore that stuff too. Actually, they learned to ignore it very early, because they were on Slashdot. (<a href=""http://kottke.org/08/07/just-dont-look"">Kottke's dictum</a>, which I find personally problematic because I'm feeble and can't pull myself away from this shit, is practiced by large swaths of online culture. It doesn't seem like it from this view, but it's actually the majority opinion.)<br />
<br />
Read Matt's point again. It's not saying that commenters suck everywhere -- it's that commenters suck in the places that <em>we actually used to care about</em>. When I was writing my NYmag story about commenters (it never got published), Coen made this point about what has changed: there's now a little input box below everything. This is EXACTLY the point that Haughey/Waxy make: Once the provence of select publications, it's now ubiquitous. (I like Andy's point about the box appearing below newspaper stories being the moment the shift became visual.)<br />
<br />
The thing to be wary of here is elitism. If forced to decide between the current anarchic state of affairs and one where feedback was restricted, I pick the former. Thankfully, this isn't a zero sum game. (99 seems to suggest that the right community management software can fix these woes. Paradoxically, MeFi is testament to that entire philosophy. I suspect we'd disagree on whether his product solutions are actually the best ones though. But who knows!)<br />
<br />
So back to the history books. I tried to make this point at the top, but the YM crowd disagrees with it. First, things we agree upon: yes, hater culture always existed and yes, it's dependent on factors including mass and technology. (That's my point about Tumblr -- it accidentally contributes to a kind of discourse that's different than ""normal"" commenting. It's like trying to argue with someone on LiveJournal without using LiveJournal.) <br />
<br />
The place we disagree is this: where there was once a place of refuge (personal sites, small community sites), there no longer is. You think that's because of volume, 99 thinks it's technology, I think it's cultural. That is, <em>because the expectations of online discourse are now shared and ubiquitous, we expect to see the same roles played out on every site</em>. <br />
<br />
<em><strong>That</strong></em> is the YouTube problem. Not the content (the comments themselves); rather, the form: the sheer ubiquity of that little box where people type into, and the expectations it has now set for commenting. <br />

<br />
I think it's very clumsy to just dump a commenting form on a website and take zero additional steps in tending to the discussion. Say what you will about the cost of professional moderation, assisting software, marketing, or whatever it takes to create good discussions. The thing is, these things work, they work better than a lonely comment form, and a surprisingly small percentage of online communities are getting this niche right. Sure, Slashdot and Ars Technica have it down pat. Well, they sorta had it right as far back as eight years ago. Metafilter has also worked continuously and effectively on this. I'm not going to complain about the sites that are not getting it completely right, but I will say there's huge potential in making this work for the other 99% of communities and users. <br />

<br />
I can understand wanting to leave but also wanting to stay. I think the solution now isn't more of the same services we're seeing now, but instead better filtering.<br />
<br />
We're aggregating so much, but have no real, smart way to say ""just give me the good stuff."" Facebook introduced some OK settings for the News Feed (found at the bottom of the Home page, you can set what types of ""news"" you want and also ""more or less"" of a certain people) but I don't think it goes far enough. <br />
<br />
I would like to see some sort of service (presumably done as an algorithm, but maybe a form of predictive A.I.) that monitors my behavior and interests on the fly. Then, as I surf it blocks the noise in my browser and requests from these services more signal. <br />
<br />

19684,5003,"katiebakes","http://katiebakes.tumblr.com","Does anyone else think that Facebook may already be doing this? <br />
<br />
My reasoning: remember a few months back when some of their code went haywire and if you clicked in the blank search field, five names came up? These names were determined by some algorithm that determined the five people you'd most likely want to see. (Ironically, it often came up as being people, like exes, that you'd <i>least</i> want to see but that you'd spent enough time clicking on anyway to make the system think otherwise.) Facebook quickly pulled the search-box glitch thing.<br />
<br />

i am not sure scott nails it when he says ""Again and again, he returned to a basic, perhaps the basic, philosophical question facing anyone with a blank screen and a story to tell."" it's true that DFW spent some time on this, but wasn't his writing about an issue even more fundamental than that, i.e., who am i, and what am i doing here? for scott to focus on the meta-writing makes DFW seem more aloof than he really was. if anything, he was trying to get <em>past</em> the meta so he could focus on the more important issues.

There's LOTS of innovation of course, but it's on the fringes. I don't know how you classify Grizzly Bear, the Unicorns, and Annimal Collective, but they're sure not mainstream rock, and it seems like that branch of music is the only thing going in terms of creative rock music.<br />

Two nuggets I found:<br />
<br />
First, the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnZMtczw9x8"">rough edit</a> by Samuel Bayers that Kurt didn't like is up on YouTube.<br />
<br />
And this great <a href=""http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=416"">first-person story</a> of someone in the video:<br />
<br />
""I was actually in the Smells Like Teen Spirit video (pan of crowd, girl playing with her hair in the middle-ish row). A couple of things I'd like to correct from above: The mosh pit didn't develop at the end of the day. It started at around the second take of the crowd's actions and disintegrated from there. In fact the director (Sam Bayer) make a huge gaffe in that he did a ""practice run"" but didn't film it. During the practice run the crowd on the bleachers actually made a pit on the bleachers themselves. This was never repeated because by the second or third take all that kept happening was camera hogs running up in front of the camera to ensure on-screen time. So that whole thing about the kids getting angry because it was a long day and then wanting to destroy the set because of their anger is B.S. I didn't see anyone who was angry. Just rambunctious. It's not like they didn't feed us. Additionally, the set was comprised of a sweep, drum kit, a basketball hoop, and bleachers. It's not like you could really destroy anything other than the drums. The hanging from the basketball hoop was encouraged because it was good film -- not because teen angst got in the way. Another thing that's mistaken above is that I believe the cheerleaders were just regular actresses (not strippers). The tattoo sleeves were makeup. This was really cheesy. It would have made more sense to have had L7 as the cheerleaders, but maybe they were on tour at the time. On the what's true side of the equation, flyers for the shoot were handed out at the Roxy show and Chaka was a very well known graffiti artist at the time.""","09/24/08 16:03:16",0,"24.21.66.195"

<br />
Sorry to burst everyone's bubble, but when this song was written, everyone was paranoid at the time the song was released about ""catching AIDS"". Back then, AIDS was a big worry for young people -- like Kurt Cobain. Read the lyrics and you'll see almost every verse is a veiled comment on AIDS. I put the lyric interpretation in parenthesis (like this): Load up on guns and bring your friends (everyone bring booze and drugs to the party) It's fun to lose and to pretend (even if you think youre a loser, pretend youre cool, being cool means ""who cares what people think?"") She's over bored and self assured (the hot chicks are bored, and want to have sex with bad boys) And all I know are dirty words (Im a bad boy, so I get the hot chicks) ""Hello, hello, hello, how low? (""How low"" can a person go?) ""With the lights out, it's less dangerous (Have sex in the dark without a condom, it seems less dangerous) Here we are now, entertain us (disdain and cynicism for sex education and warnings about AIDS - sneering at the authorities, makes them laugh ""entertain us"") I feel stupid and contagious (I am horny so I dont think about the consequences that I might have AIDS and might give it to someone) Here we are now, entertain us A mulatto (CIA secret testing of AIDS virus on Africans - look it up) An albino (Albinos supposedly are immune to AIDS - look it up) A mosquito (The AIDS virus was spread in Africa by mosquitoes infected by CIA germ warfare spooks  look it up) My libido (My sexual urges cant stop me from from having sex even though I might have AIDS) I'm worse at what I do best (I'm good at sex, but I might have AIDS so that makes me 'worse') And for this gift I feel blessed (I'm so good, that nobody asks me if I have AIDS before we have sex) Our little group has always been (all my friends sleep around casually) And always will until the end (we have sex until the disease kills us all) ""And I forget just why I taste (oral sex) Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile (likes reaction of partner) I found it hard, it's hard to find (male/female sexual organ comparison) ""Oh well, whatever, nevermind (casual sex has no answer, its just done without thinking) A denial! (Don't worry, I dont have AIDS and I wont catch AIDS) Kurt was never said to have AIDS, but wrote this song definitely laughing in the face of the heavy paranoia of AIDS and the history of how AIDS supposedly came about. The sleazy hooker cheerleaders and the teenage abandon in the song video backs up this song interpretation. I wrote this interpretation when the song came out, over 17 years ago. <br />

I wasn't a big Nirvana fan at the time (or ever since, for that matter), but I have two personal stories here: 1) my first time hearing Smells like Teen Spirit was a live cover at a battle of the bands in my high-school auditorium and 2) Teen Spirit, as I'm not sure everyone remembers, was a target-marketed deodorant, which I recall was advertised on book-covers distributed at my high school. I remember being somewhat disgusted with all this at the time, so when I heard Nirvana's version of the song and realized what the title was, I had sort of a ""fuck yeah"" moment, wherein I realized a) the cynical lengths marketers will go to to sell a product b) that for a pop song to mock something so specific marked a major shift (shall we say a sea change) away from the crappy pop-metal I'd sort of been herded into ""liking"" up to that point and c) had a sort of glimpse into a future that ended up materializing, wherein a clever idea can go from something you share with a few close friends to something the whole world is in on, which of course with the youtube and whatnot nowadays is the case in a way that is several orders of magnitude beyond what anyone at the time could even have imagined.

The boy CIT billets, James Zackheim and Mike Hollend, played air-guitar behind us and Mike wore ripped sweatpants with a hole in the crotch, if memory serves, and rolled around on the ground with his legs in the air, which made for a crowd-pleaser behind us. <br />

You might even enjoy a few abortive IM conversations and a brief birthday phone call.<br />
<br />
In each case the contact is so brief and so well-managed that you remain convinced that this one is out of your league.<br />
<br />
Then you finally corner her in a moment of weakness and she says, ""Sure, fly on up for a visit.""<br />
<br />
You arrive to find that the pics are six years out of date, her body is ruined by postpartum fat and surgical scars and her apartment is strewn with fast food wrappers and mysterious bits of male clothing.<br />
<br />
All the cool people she used to hang out with have left for greener pastures, leaving nothing but a house full of cats and an astonishing network of contacts from Second Life.<br />
<br />
You've waited six years to be in this apartment, now all you want to do is wash your hands and run away.<br />
<br />
That's how it feels to get linked by Gawker in 2008.<br />
<br />
All the cool commenters are gone, everybody you wanted to impress has moved to Radar and you're stuck with a vague, queasy conviction that linking you is the ultimate proof of their decay.<br />

A better question: why can't Rex let the GNR thing go? Is he honestly expecting the forthcoming album to have some sort of redeeming qualities?<br />
<br />
There is a sort of argument you could pretend to make for the BB-exclusive: Axl's target market has never used iTunes (plus artiste Axl hates the idea of an album as just the sum of its songs), BB has stocked GNR disks all this time and they've sold reasonably well, and Axl probably (rightly) doesn't expect the album to sell like crazy and is eager to settle for an up-front deal. <br />
<br />
Nonetheless, it should be obvious that this deal will NEVER HAPPEN, and moreover what sane person could possibly care?<br />

No. <br />
<br />
I can't ""let it go"" because I grew up with it, wrote about Axl ostentatiously, find it a cultural age-specific joke now.<br />
<br />
Specifically though, I'm curious about the aging of the audience of GNR. Because I grew up in the deep midwest, I don't know if it's my mechanic friends who will buy this record (or actually not buy this record) or my yuppie friends who will buy this record (or actually not buy this record).

There's a writer named Zulfikar Ghose who's classified as a 'South Asian postcolonial' writer - but he generally writes vaguely magic-realist stuff set in South America.

20061,5229,"Eric",,"To refine and augment what I said, let's recognize the ""does she mean it or not?"" effect that she evokes in her audiences.  Let's say she says something nasty and stereotypical about black people, for example, in her silly voice and looks you right in the eye with the exaggerated happy smirk. A delicious discomfort hangs in the air between you as you try to process what she just did. If you've seen enough of your stuff, the dialogue in your head goes like this, ""Is she just saying out loud what lots of people really think but know they can't say, and in that way is she pillorying them (us)? Is that the point of her saying it, to make us look full on at the little uglies inside ourselves that we don't acknowledge?  Or does she actually kind of think that way herself and knows she can get away with saying it because she can easily say that it was just a joke? And is that situation richly satisfying for her in an exhibitionist sort of way? Is it some of both?""  <br />
<br />
The point is that you never really know her motivation or true message, and she never breaks character. So I can see that there's a brilliance there in terms of being able to be enigmatic while making people really think and never giving enough info to allow them to decide one way or another. That's one of the measures of success for a truly challenging piece of art, really. It asks questions, makes you think, but gives no answers.  So she gets credit as a master craftsperson. But it still means you can never rely on her for anything factual or genuine because she shows no cards. I mean, if she did a breast cancer awareness bit, you'd be thinking, ""Is she really just mocking celebrities who do cancer awareness bits, and us for being influenced by them?"" It's impossible to tell whether she really genuinely cares about anything or if everything is a big joke to her, all things being ridiculous and mockable, all people being stupid rubes. That would say more about her than everyone else, but would also be another reason not to use her as your spokesperson for anything. She can make you think, but think what? If you're pushing a product or position, that question has a specific answer. Not with her though.  More fart jokes please!","10/15/08 10:42:52",0,"70.91.144.121"

Frum avoided her question, trying to bait her into just the kind of ""debate"" he decries, while Maddow kept the conversation on point, letting him hang himself with his own words.

<br />
<i>I haven't been watching Maddow's new show enough, but this make me think she's not reaching for something bigger than that talking points.</i><br />
<br />
I think that's true. What you're missing if you only saw the Youtube clip was the context of this particular episode -- the hate spilling forth at McCain/Palin rallies. She specifically asked him about his quote ""those who press this William Ayers line of attack are whipping Republicans and conservatives into a fury that's going to be very hard to calm after November"" and he responded by essentially equating her show with that fury. So I think her response was appropriate, and his attempt to condemn ""sarcasm"" in a cable news/opinion show was just a tactic to rile her.<br />
<br />
<i>Meaning: Does every TV show need to be The Daily Show? Does every blog need to be Gawker? </i><br />
<br />
You can't really be serious, can you? There's the Daily Show, there's Colbert, there's Olberman, and there's Maddow. That's *four* shows that deal with politics in a snarky, humorous or sarcastic way. Two of them are on COMEDY CENTRAL. I hardly think that merits this hand-wringing over ""tone"" in political coverage. <br />
<br />
But while we're on the subject of ""tone,"" where have you been for the last 15 years, while rightwing talk radio has been spewing forth the most vile, hateful crap imaginable? Or how about the litany of ""news"" shows on Fox where there is no semblance of balance in viewpoints, and any dissenting voices that manage to make it onto the air are either interrupted, shouted down, or have their mics turned off?

I listen to Pandora at work and they've got a Buy At Amazon MP3 button that I click when I hear a song I like. Boom, bought it. I've found so much new music that way. When they make it easy for me, they get my money!<br />

my similar theory about restaurants is if the chicken dish is good then it's a good place, because every restaurant has to have one, but a lot of them just put it there as an afterthought, and put all their effort into the meatier dishes. if it's good, then they actually give a shit. if your menu is only 6 items, all 6 should be good, you know?<br />

20310,5352,"Eric",,"I think he knew exactly what he was doing. I think he was trying to get airtime for his message at any cost. The fact that he got on Fox News, went all over the blogs, and that we're having this conversation is the indication of a successful media tactic.  If he had used the word ""shill"" instead, which would have worked just as well in the context of his argument (whether any of us agree with his argument or not), we wouldn't be talking about it right now. This is a smart guy - he knew exactly the costs and rewards of using that term, particularly in this context, and intentionally went ahead with it. I don't think it was the out-of-touch gaffe of a loony old man who is losing it. He can't get media coverage anymore without using stunts, and this one worked just like his single-word-answers press conference worked the other day.  Nobody would ever hear his message otherwise and now look at the coverage it has gotten. <br />
<br />
The question is whether the Uncle Tom part of the message, which does feel wrong, turned off everyone from the rest of the message. If it did turn everyone off, all he lost was what remained of his reputation, because nobody would have heard his message otherwise anyway. I think he is perfectly OK with sacrificing personal reputation in furtherance of his message. He knows he can't ever get elected anyway, so he doesn't have to preserve his image. And I think he feels the cause he advocates for is much more important than preserving his reputation and respect. Because of this, he can talk about critical issues that no mainstream candidate can risk talking about if they want to get elected. That's his only role - to inject issues into a campaign discourse that is largely composed of things like Bill Ayers, wardrobegate, and catchphrases.  So if any of the people who heard the message got past the Uncle Tom part and thought about the plight of the poor and their absence from the parts of the campaign that showed up in the media (not that you can't find them to a degree in official platform descriptions), then he achieved his goal.

Irrespective of Nader, I'm not listening to any bullshit false moralizing from any fake-ass Fox News muppet.  You want frequent racial insensitivity? Barely concealed racism? That joke of a network is a nest of it, a proud trumpeter of it. Those people are the real enemy. It makes me want to hurl when they pretend to adopt any kind of moral high ground. That Shep whatshisface was totally playing a fake PC role in that exchange. Ugh, his tone!  Does he think his viewers are children? Does he think anyone believes that he cares about Nader's legacy?

Of course Gillis runs a lot more then firefox on his laptop. But even still, his choice isn't based on software. The reason ""he's a PC"" is that he trashes his notebooks all the time on tour, and those Toshiba notebooks hurt a lot less to throw out.<br />

I remember very clearly typing out the text message because looking at the screen of my phone after peacefully sleeping for several hours felt like I was staring at the sun. And I also remember making sure that in spite of the difficulty of looking at the blazing screen, I made sure that the auto-text finishing my words was making them say exactly what I wanted so that I wouldn't forget my great idea when I woke up. The troubling thing to me is that when I could seemingly be so lucid while making so little sense. I'm pretty sure my note was shorthand, but beyond that I'm guessing. The ""Lions"" was likely a reference to the 0-10 Detroit Lions, but the ""extra trip to the salad bar"" appears to have crept into my waking consciousness from another universe where ""salad bar"" has a different meaning. Looking back on other some other decisions I've made in life, I have to wonder if this level of lucidness has followed me around for a long time and I'm only now realizing it.","11/19/08 11:31:47",0,"74.61.16.255"

I was the post sound engineer on Britney For The Record and I just wanted to give some insight about the music that was used. The documentary may have been executive produced by Britneys managers, but they were quite hands off with music selection. It was all picked out by like minded people who thoroughly enjoy the independent side of music and appreciate the hard work of real musicians. We used a lot of cool tracks including stuff from Four Tet, Flashbulb, Darediablo, The Album Leaf, and M83. I also contributed a few tracks to the piece with my two bands, Favors and Friends and Gannon. The whole thing was a very INTERESTING experience. (now for the shameless self promotion...) Here's a link to my bands sites, Gannon is my solo project that I've been producing tracks for since 2000. The latest disc (which has the song from the Britney doc), ""Oh Look, It's Morning Again"" was just released a few days ago, engineered and mixed by me, mastered by Mark Chalecki.<br />

Here's the idea: people who are interested in nonprofits and have informed opinions about which organizations are good and which aren't so good can share their knowledge and experiences (beyond the Network For Good model of just listing the orgs you like.) So then if you're thinking about giving to a certain org, you can read opinions/reviews of that org by other people who care about this stuff and by people who evaluate various nonprofits for a living (e.g. work at a foundation.) Sort of like give.org, but more subjective and interactive, and also with more invites to parties at bars. <br />

<br />
First is the unsettling idea that the show is milking a serious and disruptive psychological disorder for slapstick effect. It doesn't offend me as much as it makes me feel unsettled to witness the havoc and the pain. A parallel is if Doctor House kept falling down the stairs. (I understand that this concept was not introduced by Ms. Cody, she's just the ongoing lead show writer) <br />
<br />
Second, Toni Collette is a wonderful actress with some great work behind her, but her on-screen charm runs the gamut from repulsive to alluring. Even if that's the point of having her here, I'm not into it. I particularly don't want to see her imitating a truck driver. It makes me want to see what's on HBO.<br />
<br />
Speaking of... my third problem is that it's on Showtime. A complete dealbreaker.<br />

Remember: Google's results are only a guess as to what is relevant to a query - a guess based on a set of algorithms that must be comparably effective among the universe of (web-spider-accessible) known information, constrained by what a very large network cluster can compute hundreds of thousands times per second. I think a couple thousand human conversations could be a much better distiller of information, even if it's entire content is a distillation of what is on Google. It would be at least as effective as Google, and in many cases more effective as there are more inputs to human discourse beyond a web spider. As long as the relevant population size is sufficiently large - for most topics, there's always enough of a percentage of 7 billion people to have a large enough relevant group - the results will be a better guess than <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=luxury+scarves"" target=""_blank"">what Google can spit out</a>.","01/04/09 16:49:44",0,"66.108.33.105"

<br />
Actually, I was punch-drunk in love with the guy. We were on the verge of<br />
dating and did typical things like talking for hours on the phone, hanging<br />
out together, flirting, and beyond.<br />
<br />
Everything was going great, but no one was making the first move even though we had talked about dating. When he finally asked me out, I later found out that he already had a girlfriend and was playing me the whole time. As you can imagine, I was angry with the fiery passion of a thousand burning suns.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the next time we hung out I desperately wanted to ask if the rumors were true, but I never did. As the day went on, I kept thinking about all the lies this guy had told me and couldn't imagine how anyone could be so heartless. Well, he kept making fun of me about one thing or another and I finally snapped. At the time, I was holding a one pound block of Colby cheese and this guy wasn't quick enough to take cover. I had no intention of severely hurting him, but I've never seen someone go down that hard! I nailed him right in the kidney so it took him a few minutes to recover. I felt pretty bad afterwards, but he was feeling better the next day.<br />
<br />

+ Isn't it kinda interesting that he hasn't announced this redesign that everyone is talking about.<br />

+ What I like about this most: it takes the typically opposing ideas of ""simple"" and ""different"" and tries to find something nuanced in between. This is a VERY difficult balance for designers, who are told to be unique and differentiating, but also told to address simplicity and accessibility. This design sorta feels like taking that tension to the extreme.<br />

So it's interesting that a website becomes symbolic itself in this broader ideological shift, this network of symbols that, until we (you?) see what happens, are we all have. I think this is one of the reasons I like to talk about websites as ways of 'locating' things like ideology or identity. Where they once would have existed in the imagination, in 'a feeling of something' (and I think 'feeling' is actually really important to how Obama will function on both a practical and emotional level), they now are 'at a place', becoming virtual reference points in a system of cultural exchange (of signs, ideas etc.) If Obama heralds a new age (I'm rolling with the bombastic rhetoric for now), and the new digital age is all 2.0-y, then it's just sorta' interesting of how a website, itself marked out as a symbol in the online era, becomes a cultural reference point.

She got linked by somebody and somebody and somebody because she was mildly odd and spastic. The linkers were bored and said, ""Check out this spastic girl."" Had something more interesting happened that day, they wouldn't have bothered. Through pathways unclear, this below-the-radar level of interest was artificially but exponentially inflated by virtue of the number of links and reblogged links that ensued. I saw links and didn't click, because it did not sound interesting. Then I saw more links and didn't click, same deal (but early adopter memers were clicking already). As the links persisted, this thing of no interest to me became something that finally crossed the threshold, tipped the point, so to speak. ""This thing is still here,"" I said to myself. ""I wonder why it persists?"" I clicked it from fimoc and watched it and went, ""huh, high school girl youtube silliness. Whatevs,"" and moved on. I theorize that this happened en masse. But all of our clicks counted. And the weight of those clicks and name recognition prompted more linking. She wasn't any more interesting at this point, but she had momentum behind her, as a thing, an identifiable issue. There isn't anybody sitting around going, ""OMG, I'm in love with this girl,"" or ""I can't stop thinking about this girl. She's amazing."" It's just that she's a thing, and she has a unique name with brand-friendly uniqueness. And at a certain level, the requisite haters moved in to perform their prescribed takedown function. Unfortunately for Boxxy, but interestingly and helpfully for meme-trackers, it was the 4chan haters that latched onto her unintended getting above herselfness. So she went from meme to event and it bled over into real life. That's where it got ugly. But we must look back and see that, as with other unwitting microcelebs, the original product was of little actual interest. The interesting part is in the echo chamber magnification.

21057,5652,"Rachel Sklar","twitter.com/rachelsklar","This article pissed me off. Ron Rosenbaum is cranky and completely unfair here. Billy Joel has done some wonderful work, from fun pop songs to those ""message"" songs that Rosenbaum turns his nose up to (sorry, I like ""Allentown."" And ""Downeaster Alexa."" And ""Goodnight, Saigon""). The hipster derision for Billy Joel took me by surprise when I first encountered it and I haven't understood it since. Maybe it's because I grew up with Billy in the same breath as Bruce - and got 'em both from my beloved older brother, who also gave me the gift of AC/DC and Rocky Horror as a very precocious 8-year-old - but for me, Billy Joel has held up over the years in which I have presumably become far more sophisticated. <br />
<br />
Also, he's REALLY holding up protestations from Catholic girls about ""Only The Good Die Young?"" Jesus. That's a great song lyrically, tonally, and tune-fully. (Also, as a lyricist I have to say that Billy Joel songs are great to write to - the meter is always easily matched with the tune and the structure is clear and unforced. What Ron Rosenbaum sneers at as muzak is actually the effortless artistry of construction so as not to distract from the whole. So there.) <br />
<br />
Furthermore, I see no evidence that Rosenbaum really DID spend time with an extended BJ oeuvre. (Dude is RIDICULOUSLY prolific.) I'm sorry, ""Summer, Highland Falls"" is just flat-out lovely. So, too, from that album is ""I've Loved These Days"" (and never mind ""Angry Young Man"" - come on, like angsty bloggers can't get behind that?). I would add ""Vienna Waits For You"" which has been included on more mix tapes and CDs for more boys than I could possibly recall; ""Honesty"" (such a lonely word!); ""Big Shot"" which inspired the 8-year-old me to stick a spoon up her nose, but that's another story; ""Don't Ask Me Why"" (just always liked it); ""My Life"" (blared for parental benefit many times from the kids' rooms in our house - suburban Jewish rebels!); ""You're My Home"" (LOVELY); ""Falling of the Rain"" (also lovely); ""Half A Mile Away"" (about the tension between ambition and obligation, but not whinily so)(also in that vein: ""Zanzibar"" and others on ""52nd Street""); ""A Matter of Trust"" (well, isnt' it?); yes, ""Italian Restaurant"" (screw you, Rosenbaum, I'm still rooting for Brenda and Eddie to get back together); and ""For The Longest Time"" - this is a guy who liked to experiment with different forms, and it rarely felt awkward. (And yes, this includes ""We Didn't Start The Fire."" Which I happen to LIKE. So you can all bite me.) <br />
<br />
Upshot: His stuff is incredibly hooky, tuneful, and ENJOYABLE. Dare I say, fun (Caroline, you may be right - I may love doing BJ at karaoke). And the piano is terrific. He's just a damn good musician and songwriter, and deserves much, much better than what Rosenbaum serves up. Even if he did marry a 22-year old. <br />
<br />
Oh and also: ""She's Got A Way."" I declared as a teenager that I would marry whoever played that for me. Alas, no one has. But it's a damn fine love song. <br />
<br />
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go open a bottle of red or a bottle of white, because now I really feel like listening to some Billy Joel.<br />

Conversely, contra Rosenbaum, I'll add that I'm not sure what makes it all that different from Springsteen or Mellencamp. There's the same kind of working class posturing going on, and as soon we try to claim that Springsteen seems more ""authentic,"" the entire argument seems to crumble.<br />
<br />
So I'm not sure if Rosenbaum completely pulled this one off, but he's onto something. (Chuck's pieces was actually a little better at getting to the tension of BJ, but Chuck ultimately comes down as a fan, even though BJ supposedly hated the profile.)<br />

It's also worth saying that if a singer is gritty, authentic, erotic, self-conscious, and exceptionally poetic, he/she can also be terribly uninteresting, depressing, non-entertaining and/or obnoxious.

""Lovely"" just means that ""You're My Home"" communicates a lovely sentiment - and I have no problem with the sentimentality because I don't find it ""faux"" in the least. (I will say I have never loved ""Just The Way You Are"" because of this line: ""I don't want clever conversation"" - that's very different than trying ""some new fashion"" or changing the color of her hair - that goes to her intellect and substance and so I never liked that). But the flip side of ""lovely"" is ""poignant"" and he gets that in spades on a lot of the songs mentioned (""I've Loved These Days"" - which was the song that leapt to mind reading Caroline's Dodgeball eulogy, and I believe I twittered accordingly). I also think that what Rosenbaum sees as contemptuous I see as the work of someone rising in fame and fortune and working through that - I like the recurring theme of ambition, and the tensions that it can cause in the rest of your life. I've always contextualized it as happening during/after the fall of his marriage to his first wife, Elizabeth (who I think was also his manager) - you can see issues of trust and obligation and ambition and the struggle for asserting identity and independence in a lot of these (I hear that in ""52nd Street"" especially.) <br />
<br />
In some sense there is more of an authenticity in Billy Joel because he's willing to acknowledge the presence of limos and parties and wealth and the good and bad trappings that come with it all, as opposed to Bruce whom I adore, but who has not really incoporated that stuff into his work even though he's obviously incorporated it into his life. (Mellencamp married a supermodel too - whatever - the guy who starred in ""Falling From Grace"" obviously doesn't have the same issues as the guy in ""The Authority Song"" but that's cool, I can still get his point in ""Pink Houses."") For me, authenticity is in the message, and in the intent - I'm not going to judge them for their success, especially when they use it to continue publishing message songs. <br />
<br />
(Also, let's not forget that it was BJ who went to Russia, and BJ who paused in the middle of his Grammy performance to take a stand against the corporate ratings-meisters. What's more authentic than standing up to the Man on live TV?) <br />

One of the snarkiest, funniest books ever written.<br />
<br />
Billy Joel is a perfect representative of the time in which he was writing. Hipsters hate him because that time has passed.<br />
<br />
The people defending him now are the people who grew up listening to Billy Joel songs at important ceremonial events during high school.<br />
<br />
People who had fun, learned something, or got laid during those events remember Billy fondly.<br />
<br />
Those who didn't became bitter, holier than thou critic types, using their hatred of mainstream pop culture to vent their hatred of everybody who actually enjoyed prom.<br />
<br />
Hipsters hate him because to them, Billy is the perfect representative of a context that has passed.<br />
<br />
Billy Joel represents an army of GenX kids who grew up listening to him in the 80's and an army of Boomer parents who rocked out to him in the 70's.<br />
<br />
Billy Joel appeals to Boomers AND GenXers, so by hating him, hipsters can declare their hatred of both generations at once.<br />
<br />
Anyone who looks at music objectively can find reasons to hate people like Billy Joel and Barry Manilow, but for most people, music is not consumed in a sterile critical context.<br />
<br />
Music is consumed at awkward high school parties and in the back of substandard hand-me-down cars.<br />
<br />
If you grew up in the 80's, odds are your early contact with the opposite sex happened while Billy Joel was playing on the radio.<br />
<br />
The advent of your first crush or first breakup almost certainly had Billy Joel mixed in there somewhere, simply by virtue of him being played on the radio every 15 minutes while we were growing up.<br />
<br />
Most can't separate the quality of the music from the power of those events.<br />
<br />
Those who can are critic personalities like Joe Queenan, and probably Rex, who adopt an elitist set of cultural values to put themselves eternally above the banality and frustration of their upbringing.<br />
<br />
I can look back now and admit that Garth Brooks was a terrible artist, but some of my happiest memories happened at a middlebrow pool hall listening to Garth and screwing around with my friends in the early 90s.<br />

in regards to his fakeness/inauthenticity/hypocrisy:  perhaps we are also overly sensitive to so-called ""hypocrites"" (the faked, the inauthentic)d because of our own insecurities.

That said, I do have to agree with much of Ron's criticisms, as over the top as they are. My girlfriend has made these points to me -- very convincingly over the past years, and much more gently (whew!). So I will concede that in some songs, Billy can come across as a self-pitying, egocentricist, misogynist crank. As much as i deplore those tendencies in his work, I don't think that sums him completely and remain an unabashed fan.<br />
<br />
For one thing, you either love melody or you don't. And more than any other contemporary pop artist since the Beatles, Billy Joel's melodies have an unshakable warmth. <br />
<br />
Secondly, the attitude which is so often dismissed for being so superficial, is actually much fuller than his detractors would ever give him credit for. Ultimately, Billy Joel, whether singing about Captain Jack or Catholic girls or what Rock n Roll is to him, is always a worthy conversationalist. You walk away thinking, ""This guy doesn't know what he's talking about, but I like the way he says it."" <br />
<br />
Billy Joel, like Woody Allen (who is also often the subject of over-the-top hate from critics), is very self-depracating. And often, the depracating is directed outward, but usually in a gently mocking, not mean-spirited way.<br />
<br />
I have to concede that my girlfriend -- who would keel over  if I ever played ""Just The Way You Are"" for her -- has  a great point about Billy falling into the category of ""Noodge-Rock."" From Bigshot to You May Be Right to Honesty (that one in particular ""sends shivers of disgust up my spine,"" she says), the singer is a hectoring character, complaining, complaining, complaining.<br />
<br />
But to me, the vocal performances are so strong, the production so perfectly layered, and melodies so irresistible, I just have to forgive his lapses they way I would a friend who's always talking nonsense, but is nonetheless, fun to have around.<br />
<br />
I could go on about why Billy Joel arouses such bile in critics, but in the cases of Rosenbaum, Christgau and others, I think it's that they recognize their own worst tendencies toward pretentiousness and self-righteousness and instead of flagellating themselves, they see a much more attractive target in someone who's gained success, riches and fame off it. Most importantly, because Bill Joel maintains his ""I'm just a regular guy from Hicksville"" stance, it invalidates their vain attempts to rise to a more elite position. That Billy celebrates and sees himself as a schlub infuriates the sense that they had to leave that part of them behind. ","01/26/09 13:47:53",0,"24.90.84.98"

Totally agree there is angst there, just not at the same level of rebellion/disenfranchisement of other groups over the same time. I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone who defined BJ's music as being an angry/frustrated catalog.

Oh gawd, that quote is so much like his Eeyore alter-ego. <br />
<br />
Anyway, well, if we're saying that rebellion = quality music, then we're basically taking the hipster side of the argument. And I could find you a couple of million essays on why hipsters are the Worst Demographic Ever. But that said, I do think that angst is at the heart of a lot of soulful music, and that it's not a guarantee of quality but it sure does add flavor. And Billy Joel has an adult-level angst in his lyrics (the rebelliousness in acts like the Sex Pistols and Nirvana is ultimately juvenile) that, for many people, connects with them personally and/or professionally. Also, his composing abilities are very good, which is something that he gets little credit for from his lyrical detractors in these sorts of discussions. You know, because the 4-minutes-straight of distortion and four-chord progressions in punk rock is really the summit of musical accomplishment.<br />
<br />
But then again, if you're a fanatic for anarchy, sophomoric tendencies, and cacophony, there's very little there for you in the Billy Joel canon. Personally, I do like the Ramones and the Sex Pistols, they're all in the Hall of Fame, we don't have to tear anyone down for their shortcomings like RR is curiously doing.","01/26/09 16:47:40",0,"66.108.33.105"

Can we hold off on the hipster-bashing and the questioning of other critic's motives? I realize Rosenbaum's piece isn't the most generous, but still.<br />

Rachel is the only one (including Rosenbaum) who's brought up any musical qualities, and even those are pretty vague: song structure and likeability. I've got nothing against simple catchy songs--""Yesterday"" or ""Pale Blue Eyes"" or whatever--but that's not what BJ is doing.  Those songs have melodies that take the whole verse to resolve, Anthony's Song (sorry, no BJ in the house so I have to use that as an example) pauses after each phrase, and you know instantly where the melody is going.  It takes absolutely no attention span to follow.  <br />
<br />
If that were all, then he'd just be a catchy songwriter.  But on top of that he adds unearned bombast without the aggressiveness that would make it at all challenging.

My feeling about his stuff is that it just works - that's what I was getting at regarding structure and how easily the lyrics find the melody line - that's not as easy to manage as he makes it look. He's also excellent at accents - the whistle in ""Allentown,"" the rotors in ""Goognight Saigon,"" even that breaking glass in ""You May Be Right"" - I feel like he just makes things fit.

<br />
I'm not making the case for Billy Joel as better than Bruce Springsteen or even ""He is the greatest pop singer ever!"" My point is that the opprobrium and vitriol that is hurled at him by critics over the years has been out of proportion.<br />
<br />
For example, I have never seen any impassioned screeds inveighing against the likes of REO Speedwagon or Journey or Styx.<br />
<br />
I bring up those bands to offer a contrast. Billy Joel's music, all of itl, has a much more personal, visceral quality than the run of the mill pop song.<br />
<br />
Even a song so vilified like Just The Way You Are or Honesty is so unusual on so many levels. Typically, love songs are either all hearts and flowers or Wagnerian pleas of ""I can't live, if living is without you!"" Billy Joel's song lyrics are mundane and direct and conversational and natural. The tend to evince a deep well of self-doubt and self-deprecation, which is either deep or cloying depending on how you want to see it.<br />
<br />
As for the music, again, those two songs are pretty standard ballads, the first a by-the-numbers bossa nova and the second, a kind of old world tin pan alley tune. But to me, because of their familiarity -- sure, throw the word derivative at them, as if everything the Rolling Stones and even the ground-breaking Velvet Underground didn't have some precedent before them -- it works, as Rachel said. And I take that to mean, it just sounds good to your ears and your heart. (Jeez, I'm kind of sounding like Billy Joel here).<br />
<br />
Or to stand up for Still Rock N Roll To Me, I am not ashamed to say that it has an infectious bass lines and updates '50s chord progressions in way I couldn't really point to anywhere else. Secondly, the images and references are vivid, while his complaint that categorizing rock music -- I know, he should have said ""pop music"" -- is irrelevant. Just listen and enjoy and forget about genre games.<br />
<br />
I actually gave up on Billy Joel for a long time and gravitated toward more sophisticated music like Elvis Costello (who once mocked Just The Way You Are -- a song now being covered by his wife, Diana Krall) and became more interested in other indie tastes and thought that Billy Joel's brand of populism was tired and dry. But a few years ago, maybe it is nostalgia the bred by carrying around an iPod with thousands of songs in it, I just started listening again.

He's a guy from the working class talking directly and naturally to the working class (or if you prefer, a ""regular guy"" talking to other regular guys/girls) in their own language, on their own terms. They see something duplicitous in him that isn't there because they can't imagine being that direct without being ironic.<br />
<br />
They invariably prefer frauds like Bruce Springsteen, who has made a career out of condescending to those same people, but does it in a way that critics can imagine themselves doing (by constructing exaggerated stories about them that could not possibly be true, speaking for them in a voice they could not possibly use, etc).   The Piano Man <em>actually happened</em>, something people who have ben fucked in the ass by irony either don't get or can't stand.  I don't want to seem to run artificiality down, but the reaction is a bit childish.<br />
<br />
So let's dispose of the moral argument there.<br />

More importantly, Springsteen can't write a tune to save his goddamn life.  Billy Joel may be guilty of schlock, but he's never guilty of not being fun, and seems incapable of writing something you can't hum.  Occasionally hokey and sentimental?  Sure, but with a wink, and joyfully so.  I lok at Billy Joel and see a guy who's part of a songwriting tradition going back through Vaudeville all the way back to Ireland.

<br />
Gruber is an interesting example. I agree that there isn't the same kind of backlash around what he does. I wonder why that is. The reasons could include:<br />
<br />
1) <strong>He's a nice guy.</strong> And he probably is...<br />
<br />
2) <strong>His audience is more self-defined.</strong> Daring Fireball's audience is pretty cohesive, not a ton of outsider voices.<br />
<br />
3) <strong>His community isn't open.</strong> No comments, right? Kottke has the same thing going on, and I think that helps shed the negativity. <br />
<br />
4) <strong>He's smaller.</strong> But he's not <em>that small</em>, so maybe not.<br />
<br />
5) <strong>He's non-controversial.</strong> Actually, I'm not sure this is true. He goes to bat for issues on occasion.<br />
<br />
6) <strong>He's not a dick.</strong> This is the wildcard, because dick-ness seems a perceived quality that has to do with the factors above. Or, maybe I'm wrong, and it's a simple personality difference that differentiates him.<br />
<br />
So what is it? Which of those makes him different from Calacanis and Arrington? <br />
","01/28/09 23:19:27",0,"66.65.43.140"
21177,5667,"APR",,"W/r/t Gruber, I think the self-defined, smaller community aspect of it may play a large role (that said, he certainly seems willing to take shots at Arrington et al on his Twitter account). I think he mostly succeeds because he doesn't see himself as just a blogger, but as a journalist. I don't know this for certain, but I would suspect that he does believe in ethics and accountability. He certainly can be dick-like (see his Jackass of the Week posts), but I think he's self-aware enough to know that he could be accused of being a Jackass himself, which I think propels him to be smart and accurate in his posts.<br />
<br />
But really, I have no idea. I've thought about it, but haven't been able to actually articulate this properly.<br />
<br />
The one thing I have thought about (and this is not a new argument, I'm sure) is that the two internet worlds largely in discussion, which I think of as the TechCrunch/Gizmodo sphere and the Gawker/Tumblr sphere, are creating things that seem temporary and disposable. They have no weight behind them -- perhaps because they post so frequently, and perhaps because they post without much thought. Structurally, they <em>feel</em> somewhat similar to reading 4chan. I'm not saying the posters feel that -- I feel like someone like Julia Allison* is absolutely sincere when she posts things, but since she her posts are frequent and lightweight, they make it easier to attack her. I just stopped reading her, and a lot of blogs (including Gawker, TechCrunch, etc.) simply because reading them would make me angry, which made no sense to me. I still check in once in a while, when I feel like making fun of someone, which is partially due to my own feelings of insecurity and anger that these people are internet famous, and I'm not, and I'm much smarter than they are. It's harder to do that with someone like Gruber, because I feel like he's creating something worthwhile. Even Kottke, who I am sometimes on the fence about, I respect tremendously, because he has inculcated his own middle-brow, <em>New Yorker</em>ish voice that I find impressive.<br />
<br />
And just on a (slightly negative) personal note, I've been reading your blog regularly since my first senior year of college, back in 2001. You and Waxy and Kottke were kind of my heroes of the internet, because you were doing interesting things, and you were talking about culture in interesting ways, each with your own different spin. You guys made me want to get involved in the internet. But I feel like your tone has changed somewhat dramatically in the last few years, with all these issues. I sometimes wonder if you moved to New York to be more famous. I realize none of this really matters, and you seem happy in New York, so that's good. I just feel like you were more about creating cool new interesting things back in the day. I wish I could articulate this better; I respect you a lot and will still read you regardless.<br />

I mean, it's an incredible testament to his skill that it's not until Kottke has someone guest edit that you see how much his site is an expression of his own personal editorial voice.

I think Rex definitely has a point. MySpace took off for bands because it made it so easy to throw music up and build a home for yourself without having to hire web developers. Of course part of the appeal was that your fans were also on it, and you could connect with them. That aspect has pretty much died off (i'm guessing?), but it's still a decent tool.<br />
<br />
But what it comes down to is how you find bands on MySpace. If you're using MySpace's own search tool, that's one thing. But most people are getting to bands pages through google. That means that bands can use whatever service comes along that they prefer, and people will be able to find them.<br />

A massive part of the economy was based on the idea that you couldn't lose money in the internet--that we were on a new frontier, and if you weren't going into some internet-related field, well, then you better be investing in it. Things didn't go very well that first time around, and it looked like the internet and all its dancing gophers may have been a bad idea, but we climbed our way out and built a massive dumping ground for the world's knowledge. Then the other day I asked someone where the Super Bowl was being held. We couldn't figure it out, and it forced me to consider how I would track down such information without access to the net. What's troubling isn't that I would have a hard time finding the information without the internet, but that I struggle with the critical thinking skills required to find out where the game's being held. I would argue that, like the inevitable dotcom bubble burst that no one saw coming, we're now susceptible to a global meltdown in trivial knowledge since it exists only on the internet.","01/30/09 11:48:14",0,"64.81.162.175"

<br />
But I disagree with that part about how 'culture is a mating ritual,' though, violently. When I'm alone, I listen to what makes me happy. Sure, I pick stuff up because it's recommended or buzzy - but I'm sorry, when I feel like listening to music I'm just going to listen to what I like, so I can like what I listen to. And that can be Billy Joel or Bruce or ""Crazy on You"" by Heart or that song I will find myself singing along to in the Duane Reade and then I'll walk to the cash, still singing, and realize that the cashier and I are singing together, or the showtunes that other people write off as ""showtunes"" but I know to be as disparate as ""City of Angels"" or ""Chess"" or ""Into The Woods"" or ""Little Shop of Horrors"" or, fuck it, ""The Sound of Music."" Or they can be songs from old boyfriends or songs from my brother or songs I heard in a store, stopped, liked, and asked about so I could go out and buy the CD, or songs from ""West Side Story,"" which no one told me to like, my parents just took us to see it and that was it (and no one told the 8-year-old me to leave ""A Chorus Line"" singing ""Tits and Ass"" at the top of my lungs, either). The point is, you like what you like and if you REALLY like it, you spend a little time thinking about why you like it and learn a little bit about yourself through that. And then that music is yours. Try to attract someone with music that isn't yours, and they'll see right through you - if they're smart. Posers are boring. Passion is what matters. <br />

<br />
There still seem to be some ""rules"" in play as to how to comment spam.<br />
<br />
1. Try to be just on-topic enough to pass a ""scan through comments without reading them"" test, but be unable to pass a certain level of banality for those actually reading the stuff that's being written.  (This will almost always work on blogs with hundreds of comments per topic.)<br />
<br />
2. Yeah, you can include the URL in the ""URL"" field, but in their minds it stands to reason that you must ALSO include the link - the EXACT same URL - in the comment body text.  Like you'll get more ""points"" that way.<br />
<br />
3. And you might as well post more than once, preferably to separate topics, just to make sure everybody saw that URL.<br />
<br />
4. It doesn't hurt if you stick to the older topics where people might not be engaging in active discussion any more, so as to stay under the radar (except when, for example, MNSpeak would send me notifications of replies to posts I'd made two years ago)<br />
<br />
Surely this is a sign of some success of this blog that people feel there must be some sort of material gain to have their link here - Technorati authority?  Google PageRank?  Some rigmarole involving NOFOLLOW (or a lack thereof)?  Unfortunately it must somehow be easy enough for those who are greedy enough for this to make enough money to keep doing it.  I don't think *I* could do it - but it's easy to work within a moral code when you're working at a job where I can take 15 minutes and compose a comment on Fimoculous.com.<br />
<br />
I've often seen visits by people randomly clicking on my name - both here and at MNspeak - but I don't know that anything beyond that has come out of it.  I've come to accept that most people visit, see that the gathering of ""mostly people who read WrestleLine ten years ago"" over at my place, decide that that may not necessarily intersect with the folks *they're* interested in hearing from, and move on - which is simultaneously disappointing and totally understandable.<br />
<br />
In short: thanks, Rex, for making this post because clearly I wanted to go off on this, but only when it seemed less like a tangent.  Hmmm, did *I* somehow manipulate YOU?  If only I could build upon that by having a product to sell you!<br />

<br />
""Just like Gawker, HRO won't stop until we're all too afraid to do anything, to step on the rug and take a fucking chance, to give a shit. Until we're all crippled by self-consciousness, and the worry of making a mistake.""<br />
<br />
At its worst, snark is sneering at everything you care about because you're small and silly enough to care about it, or be anything other than ironically above it all. Denby and the snark-haters are reacting against the meanness, and also the gratuitousness of the meanness. But the best of snark - the clever eviscerating takedowns of people who ""deserve it"" - people who are puffed up with their own importance or nasty to their underlings or intellectually dishonest or whatnot - that also comes from a place of caring, of sussing out inauthenticity and calling people out for not being real. That's what he's getting at about John Stewart and Stephen Colbert - they're great because they are fighting the good fight by pulling back the curtain on greed and buffoonery, and if doing that makes them bullies well then they're RIGHTEOUS bullies. But Dowd (and presumably Gawker et al) he just thinks are bullies. The upshot is that Denby wants people to care, too, and to feel like the world is safe to care and say what  you mean and be authentic. So does Nick Sylvester.

Now, there are two ways to look at this: 1) the old-school journalistic way that says if you haven't pissed off someone in power today, then you haven't done your job (this is actually quite similar to the ""Gawker"" ethos), or 2) the belief that this is the knee-jerk, simplistic, over-used, and ultimately conservative way of dealing with society. <br />

Like anything else in life, there are 6 degrees of separation when it comes to spam, marketing, or both , on the internet.<br />
<br />
Let's face, links are the lifeblood of the web. Without interesting content, no other bloggers would link to you. Without other bloggers linking to your interesting content, you have no traffic. With no traffic, is there really any point to blogging?<br />
<br />
Most newbies who decide they are going to make a million dollars online have absolutely NO CLUE about the symbiotic relationship of the web, and how the ""web"" moniker came about because of the interconnected nature of all that we do here.<br />
<br />
Those of us like me who have been at this for nearly a decade and who do in fact earn a full time living online, have come to understand that we are all dependent on each other.<br />
<br />
By coming in and crafting a thoughtful, useful, on topic comment, I give something to you - more targeted content that Google will like, and your visitors may have an interest in.<br />
<br />
The only thing I ask in return for helping you is the ability to help myself a tiny bit. Leaving a link somewhere (it doesn't always have to be blatant and full of anchored text - mine certainly isn't) is nothing more than common courtesy and simple reciprocation for giving something potentially helpful to you.<br />
<br />
I 100% agree with you that spam comments are annoying, and I can also understand how easy it would be to make your link ""nofollow"". <br />
<br />
But if you can, try to keep in mind that like anything else in life, spam has many hues and shades. Try to base your deletion decisions upon the basic premise of ""was their comment useful enough and helpful enough to ME, to consider giving help to THEM in return?<br />
<br />
Whether my own comment here is now deleted or not is immaterial. I only hope that maybe it will get one person to stop for a moment and consider how truly dependent we all are on each other for links. Without eyeballs to see what it is we do (whatever that may be) there is little point for ANY of us to continue.<br />
<br />
It truly is the circle of internet life.<br />

Lots of people have been talking/thinking about how to bring back the pay model (Premium subscription? Threshold for payment? iTunes model?) but you've gone ahead and thought out something that could really work - the most difficult transaction cost involved is typing in your credit card information once, and how many of us have done that? (I know I have done it way too many times.) If we can store our information with iTunes and Amazon we can do it with the NYT, and should (and the model you cite is actually close to what they used to charge for their archived material back in the day, which yes of course I bought). <br />
<br />
I also like that you're not charged until you hit $5 - it means that you are lulled in with a small-enough gateway to not feel like you were tricked into racking up a huge bill, but it doesn't hit you with the annoying credit-card request right at the outset (New Republic, I'm looking at you). <br />

I'll disagree with Alisa where she said ""we know that users will always gravitate towards the path of least resistance...this means too that users will migrate to where they can find these sources for free.""

<br />
Rachel- people do gravitate towards that which is free...hence the mess media finds itself in right now...that said, a few other notes: the whole ""locker"" idea has nothing to do with a paid model, unless Rex you are suggesting that access to said locker is part of the value exchange to the consumer who purchases per post?<br />
<br />
Rex, you mention a micropayments solution whereby ""This system could be scaled up to become the micropayment system for all news consumption.""  Are you suggesting the creation of microformats? would this ultimately be a part of the Open / dp movement whereby my universal identity included purchasing data? (it would make sense if it did)<br />
<br />
And finally, re: presonlization and ""digital lockers""....this is where we get into the idea of data portability... what good is my firewalled NYT data if it is not portable and accessible from any application or access point on the Web? this is backwards to where we are going--which is to say towards the free exchange of data, data being all of the personal, explicit (profile info, content uploads) and implicit (content i've viewed, like, commented) actions I take (including friend connections). basically, yes, Rachel people do want access to their data histories...and with data portability the sharing of that data can happen not only on-site but off (a passive traffic-driver)<br />
<br />
if this micropayments could be tied to my universal identity, then i would say this might have more legs. i think it will be wonky for a while until we have an open web in which my identity is 1) universal and 2) my identity data is accessible anywhere on the Web (again this includes my purchasing info that would be used in said NYT scenario)","02/09/09 17:18:45",0,"74.10.180.162"

<br />
Sure, tie it to the universal identities movement. I suspect that's even further away as a realization than micropayments (unless Facebook shocks us by the end of the year). These aren't mutually exclusive movements.<br />
<br />
The ""digital locker"" idea is like a meter of things you've purchased. It's a small attempt to start to visualize your purchase history. And in theory, it can include other ""pro"" features that get added later.<br />
<br />
Also, NYT already has a robust API, and recently announced <a href=""http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/announcing-the-article-search-api/"">article search</a>. This isn't social graph data, but it's definitely important. <br />

21489,5713,"Eric",,"I hate the idea of paying for news or of doing any kind of subscription for anything (as opposed to one for one purchases), but I think some of your ideas are good. I think the $5 threshold is a very smart idea for beating surcharges, for example, and for drawing people in in a nonthreatening and seemingly charitable/trusting way. It would put people at ease and get them past an important threshold. The only drawback I see is that it would require a login to even start accruing sub-$5 microcharges, which is already a barrier to use.<br />
<br />
I think information still wants to be free, though. In the limitless plane of the internet, I think there will always be somebody or many somebodies who will provide for free what pay news sites would charge for. I don't even like being prompted to log in at news sites, much less pay for the content. When I get prompted to login or subscribe, I just go somewhere else and have what I want in a few seconds.<br />
<br />
I do think micropayments are much more likely to work than subscriptions. I base that on my behavior with cheap mp3s.  99 cents just doesn't seem like real money to me, and credit cards already feel kind of not real, and it just takes one click, so I now buy mp3s whenever the impulse registers or the song is in my head. And I never even really keep track of how much it adds up to over time. I think people are more willing to spend small amounts of money over time because it never seems like anything of consequence at any one time.<br />
<br />
But in the case of news, I think people will just flow like a river around a rock if a site tries to charge, even if it's a small amount of money. When something has been free for so long, internet news in this case, it just doesn't make sense to people to start paying for it when they can just as easily get it from somewhere else for free (and legally). My utilitarian alarm just starts dinging when I try to imagine that. I think the people who would gladly pay in this scenario are a very small minority. <br />
<br />
As to whether quality still matters, it does. But it matters less and less to fewer and fewer. I think again that there is a small minority of people who consume news to a depth that they recognize and appreciate and will pay for top quality, and they aren't enough to make the model viable. More and more we aim for shorter and more concise summaries, which leave less room for thoughtful analysis. Using myself as an example of a syndrome I've seen decried here and elsewhere, when I see one of those stories that has like 12 additional pages linked at the bottom of an already long story page (or really even more than a few), I give up on the article just about every time right there, just absorbing what I can from the initial page, once in a blue moon skipping to the last page to see how it ends, and then moving on. I wasn't that way in the past and would read a whole print paper. The new medium is changing our behavior.<br />
<br />
As for revenue,  what we used to pay for print papers wasn't really their revenue model - charging 50 cents or whatever was just so you'd associate some value with the paper and not see it as a throwaway. The real revenue has always come from the ads. I know the landscape is changing with the ability to block ads, but I still don't see subscription or pay to play as viable.  <br />
<br />
A solution like yours is probably the kind of medicine we would need to take to preserve the news industry in its current form. But I think what's more likely is that the industry will continue to change until the ecosystem supports it naturally, even if we are the worse for it. People won't embrace plans to save the current system out of enlightened self interest because we never do that. We will respond to incentives, but it takes so much more input to get the same level of output than when we are inconvenienced, deprived, threatened, or hurt. That's what really moves us to change.<br />
<br />
All of this is not to say that it won't necessarily work. Somehow Comcast has me paying $125/mo. for cable and internet subscriptions, for example, which is nuts. Somehow they made that work. I'm an unwilling customer and yet a paying one. Cable reeled us in back in the day by saying they were replacing an ad-supported model with a subscription-supported one. Now we pay crazy subscriptions to watch lots and lots of ads. Somebody somewhere is laughing at that. So smart cookies could probably figure out how to trap us in this scenario too. Reel us in, block off other options, and then start jacking things up. Don't help the Dark Side, Rex!<br />

I wish I had the space to dissect this idea more, but my biggest objection is one of human nature and business practices.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, NYTimes Select didn't work because the pool of people willing to pay wasn't large enough to be a real business. And by charging people for access, you almost guarantee that the number of subscribers is self-limiting (I think this is known inside the biz as the ""Stern On Sirius"" effect).<br />
<br />
Micropayments have the same problem, but with a larger scale. It only works if the majority of publications opt in, and that the list of opt-ins tends to be the publications with the highest quality. Otherwise, there are still too many free options. And let's be honest, how often is there some ""must-read"" content that we can't wait to read somewhere else. And any publication with the balls or the deep pockets can skip the micropayments route, and build traffic and mind-share at their competitors expense.<br />

Also, I do want to point out one thing in regards to the digital locker...that is the kind of data that marketers would pay through the nose to get a hold of. Now, marketers would literally pay individual consumers (of which the NYT could get a cut) for access or visibility into said data in return for some kind of value exchange. <br />
<br />
For example, if I am Lexus, and I know that reader X of the NYT reads all the auto articles and comments frequently about Lexus...I would be will to pay anywhere up to $500 to specifically target and acquire that customer. As a marketer, I would be willing to pay such a hefty CPA because I know that that reader is exactly who I want to target (it would help too if in their 'digital locker' was other identity data such as age, gender, HHI, etc). And again, I would be paying him, reader X, to effectively talk to him. He owns the data but NYT, being the arbiter of said data, would get a cut of that payment too.<br />

<br />
The idea of ""micropayments"" is basically forcing the consumer to pay for things so insignificant that they would otherwise not pay for. This only works in closed systems where there is no free alternative--with music, you cannot (legally) get an artist's song for free, and with video games, no one else can (legally) add new content to your games. No one <em>likes</em> micropayments, they just accept them because there's usually not an alternative.<br />
<br />
In the case of news, there <em>is</em> a legal alternative: Competing news organizations that use ad-based models. News organizations can't legally <em>own</em> the information they report on (though the AP tries) they can only own the way it's reported. There will always be a free and legal alternative to any micropaymented article. And a non-news thought piece is arguably even more interchangeable with any of the free alternatives. I get that a person's experience can add value to their opinion, but I'm not going to pay someone for their opinion if there's no ROI on it for me. Sure people will pay people for their opinion on their taxes or how to fix their computer, but I doubt many people would willingly pay to hear an ""expert's"" opinion on what Puppy Cam <em>means</em>.<br />
<br />
(Also, books are free--libraries--and people still buy them, because there's a still a demand, and no legal alternative.)","02/11/09 13:15:46",0,"71.249.201.251"

<br />
Yes, this sort of wire feed news is, undoubtedly, pervasive. And anyone who would try to monetize this kind of wirefeed approach to news would fail.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but there's not ""a free and legal alternative"" to the reporting that the New York Times does from Iraq. There's just not. <br />
<br />
If micropayments fail -- and I kinda sorta think they might, so keep that in mind -- it has more to do with the psychology of the user. (Some of the comments above point out this.) I don't think it will have anything to do with this idea that all of the information provided to the world by the Washington Post or the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times is pervasive. It's just not.<br />

21552,5721,"BradOFarrell","http://www.BradOFarrell.com","What about CNN reporting from Iraq? Or any other competitor who is currently not using a micropayment-based model? Micropayments (a friendly term for ""annoyingly nickling and diming the customer"") only really works when you have a monopoly over your product.<br />
 <br />
I'm not arguing that the news industry isn't necessary, I'm arguing that unless they have a monopolgy over their service (which they don't) then micropayments are just going to drive readers to their less-annoying competitors. I think most people would rather their free commodities remain free, and if they are suddenly expected to pay for them, it seems to me that most people would just switch brands rather than start pay. I know I would.<br />

You pay by subscription (usually bundled in with other channels), though you don't pay for the website. You also 'pay' for the local news via advertising. But that's different from micropayments.<br />
<br />
The actual <em>act</em> of having to 'confirm' to pay to read an article (that you may or may not care to finish) OR the alternative of being automatically invisibly charged per-page as you browse the website (and withe either method, you'd HAVE to log in) are both extremely unappealing. It's just an inherently annoying business model (compared to the alternative or being ad-based website, or being a free website in order to promote a subscription based TV service, like CNN, which I guess would still fall under 'advertising') and I don't think most users would put up with it.<br />

<br />
This entire idea was to tackle your last piece, that ""articles get circulated via links as part of a discussion."" Traditional subscription models TRULY hide the article, with no way to get to them without entering your credit card. This exercise was about trying to find something easier than that -- trying to keep the article in the circulation of discussion. Yes, it's true, you would have to hit the ""Buy"" button every time. I guess the question is whether that annoyance is going to drive so many people away that the model doesn't take off.<br />

Karp & Co ban some sites that are knocking their good friend and (probably) their highest profile user. In the old days, when it was just Karp and all his pals this would have been fine, kicking out the mean people attacking his circle, maybe even celebrated. But Tumblr's growing up, or trying to at least and the community of users are beyond Karp's influence. <br />
<br />
If Tumblr wants to grow from a boutique blogging service and be a real alternative to Blogger or WordPress they can't make decisions like this that seem pretty clearly to be based on personal relationships. I don't care about Julia Allison or her critics but you don't shut people down because they are knocking your friends. Alesh is right, the solution here was making some sort of reblogging stopper, not censorship. <br />

<br />
The thing is, they are fundamentally different. I do both. I think both are valid, and useful in different ways.<br />
<br />
I know people hate retweeting, but if something comes across the transom, and I think other people should see it, I re-tweet it. I tend to retweet stuff because my followers don't overlap 100 percent with the people I follow. I also tend *not* to retweet things from people with tens of thousands of followers. Why bother? <br />
<br />
I use favorites like Twitter bookmarks, much like I do with Flickr photos. I think Favrd, while entertaining, is kind of meh. The Twitter as one-liner seems a little bit stale.  <br />
<br />
But I know nobody sees the things I favorite (similarly, I don't see typically yours) I know I <a href=""http://twitter.com/fimoculous/favourites"" target=""_blank"">*can*</a> but it's not automated in the way retweeting is. I have to make an effort.<br />
<br />
In short: You retweet things because you think OTHER people should see them. You favorite things because YOU want to see them again. (Because you agree with it, love it, hate it, or whatever.) <br />
<br />
There should be a better way to handle both of these behaviors. (And related: wouldn't it be nice to *all* of your tweets that have been favorited, not just the ones picked up by favrd/favotter?) <br />

<br />
Twitter really needs to reposition its image around search and that (near) real-time information flow, getting away from ""what are you doing"" and moving towards ""what's happening."" It's a subtle but important distinction. <br />
<br />
According to Dorsey, when Twitter started out (and did you know it was almost called ""Twitch""? See below) there wasn't even a prompt for the text box. You just entered your status and that was that. They added ""what are you doing"" to make it more understandable and usable, but it seems like once it escaped the realm of early adopters, that question has been a distraction that's kept people from really getting it. It's what led to the eternally dumb ""why do I care what someone is doing"" question. (Think how silly that question would sound as ""why do I care what's happening?"")<br />
<br />
And I think you're spot on with geo stuff. They could hit search out of the park if you could do geo-tagging and filtering by tweets--so that instead of just filtering by someone's profile location it could filter by the location of where someone is when they post. For example, even when I'm posting in LA, my Twitter profile still reads San Francisco and my tweets are filtered thusly when someone does an advanced Twitter search. Twinkle  already adds this layer and then does filtering by posting location, and it seems like a natural for the service overall. Of course it means that tweets need to be geotagged first. <br />
<br />
Where that gets interesting is in a situation like Mumbai, or Galveston, or some other localized event where you want to find out what's happening on the ground in real time directly from the people experiencing it. You want to weed out people who might be based in said location but aren't actually posting there at the moment, while including people who are based elsewhere but happen to be in the area for the event. Obviously phones can already make this happen with mobile posting, while stuff like Loki is increasingly bringing it into the browser.<br />
<br />
And of course that also gives Twitter, the company, yet another layer of data to offer up for mining--not just real-time status but also real-time location--to marketers and others who might be able to help them earn a buck.<br />
<br />
Twitter really needs to reposition its image around search and that (near) real-time information flow, getting away from ""what are you doing"" and moving towards ""what's happening."" It's a subtle but important distinction. <br />
<br />
Finally, back to Twitch, this is from an interview I did with Jack Dorsey (that never ran) where he talks about where the name Twitter came from:<br />
<br />
""We wanted something that really spoke to the action,"" says Dorsey, ""and we came up with Twitch--because the phone kind of vibrates and twitches when you receive a message -- but you know Twitch doesn't really bring up the greatest images. So we looked in the dictionary around Twitch and discovered the word Twitter -- short bursts of information; chirps; inconsequential bursts of information.""<br />

22194,5779,"Rex",,"<strong>New York, February 25, 2009</strong> -- Bestselling authors Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller (Live from New York: An Uncensored History of ""Saturday Night Live"") have signed to write a wide-ranging exploration of ESPN, the hugely successful global sports network, Little, Brown and Company announced today. Currently untitled, the book will chronicle ESPN's rise from industry oddity to thriving empire, examining its tremendous, revolutionary impact on sports, television, and American life. As with Live from New York, the story will include the words of those who made it happen, speaking with authority and candor.<br />
<br />
In addition to its many other venues, ESPN is now a major presence on the Internet; appropriately, the publisher and authors have launched their own Web site (<a href=""http://www.millershalesespnbook.com/"">www.millershalesespnbook.com</a>) to feature regular blogging and updates on the book's progress. The authors have already interviewed many individuals present at the creation and growth of ESPN, as well as those who are involved with the company now. Many are speaking on the record for the first time, and there will be hundreds more interviews conducted.<br />
<br />
Shales, the Pulitzer Prize.winning TV critic of the Washington Post, says, ""ESPN has greatly expanded the appeal of sports with its personalized approach and seen its influence extend into all areas of television and communication."" Miller, who has been both an executive and a producer in the television industry, became a faithful, fascinated fan of ESPN in the early '80s. ""While working in Washington,"" Miller notes, ""I moved to Northern Virginia specifically for its advanced cable system and the chance to watch ESPN. From its infancy, it's been on the air 24/7, and friends told me it sometimes seemed like I watched it that much.""<br />
<br />
Little, Brown acquired world rights to this project. Editor in Chief Geoff Shandler, who worked with both authors on their previous book, will edit the new one. Shales and Miller were represented in the negotiations by Sloan Harris of ICM.<br />
<br />
Little, Brown and Company is a division of Hachette Book Group.

That the news *business* is not actually about the news. Its about using news (and a bunch of other stuff like cartoons and crossword puzzles) to attract attention from an audience.  And once the attention has been earned, the *business* part of the equation is about monetizing the attention.  So what will save the news?  First off, really good news. No way to attract attention online if all you are doing is writing the same story that everyone else has written (571 stories on the Obama letter to the Kremlin so far this morning according to Google News). Newspapers have to either produce or aggregate the best attention earning content in order to get people to come to them first - otherwise they will just feed other people's attention getting services.  <br />
<br />
But more importantly, newspapers have to have a thing to do (not a thing to see) when people get there which can be monetized.  Craigslist is the new model for classifieds - by the way newspapers, it can still be improved on.  Why aren't papers launching craigslist like products? Go on down the list - the electronic versions of the things we once did with papers all exist.  Papers must buy, build, or partner to obtain the services which generate revenue in the new marketplace.<br />
<br />
Its not about the news - that is just the stuff that gets an audience to show up.  It is the experience you give the audience afterwards that matters. And that is what I don't see any newspaper tackling.<br />

22360,5806,"alesh","http://buildingsandfood.com","So, I used to talk about the two possible models of what happens to bands when they achieve massive success: they either (1) try to hold on to it by repeating what's worked for them in the past or (2) use their success as a launching pad for experimentation, almost daring their audience to come with them. <br />
<br />
The original model of the latter aproach is the Beatles circa Sgt. Pepper (an I guess only slightly more updated example is Radiohead at and around Kid A). But around the time of Zooropa and Pop, I had a great Beatles/U2 analogy that I liked to spin: both bands acquired enormous international fame with a particular sound and vision, and both made a radical departure into relatively experimental, deconstructed pop (Achtung Baby sounded pretty radical when it came out, as absurd as that may seem now (and don't forget that Zooropa, while undeniably a worse album (analogy extended: Yellow Submarine), was certainly more experimental. (Also, it had at least three absolutely amazing songs, not the least of which was <a href=""http://buildingsandfood.com/great-moments-in-post-modernism-pt-2-daddys-gonna-pay-for-your-crashed-car"">Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car</a>, re which nobody read my tribute to.)) (There's also an interesting B/W before/color after aspect to the analogy which might be more of a straight tribute.)<br />
<br />
Also by the way, Zooropa, Achtung, and Pop are the only three U2 albums that I ever listen to anymore, and Pop is by far my favorite, which puts me I guess at odds with James' style of U2 apologists, but come on: Staring at the Sun, Last Night on Earth, Miami, Playboy Mansion, If God Will Send his Angels, Wake up Dead Man, and If you wear that velvet dress ... all belong on a list of U2's greatest songs; what other album has 7?!)<br />
<br />
Anyway, U2 broke my analogy when they went ""back to their roots"" with the Atomic Bomb album. And while their music since then may be serviceable and even fun, I just have absolutely no interest in hearing it. I hear it's OK, but despite being a pretty normal person with a pretty normal exposure to ""mainstream"" people, I haven't really even run across it inadvertently. Maybe once I downloaded an album, checked out a few songs, and deleted it straight away. <br />

22367,5783,"Michal Migurski","http://mike.teczno.com","Would it be fair to suggest that innovation problems and management problems are the same thing? I'm personally a fan of Bruno Latour's definition of innovation as progressive discovery of new allies, which is not too unlike a management problem: choosing a course without necessarily knowing who will help, and then helping create the conditions where new people become supporters. Quite specifically innovation is not the generation of new ideas, but the matching of new ideas to appropriate supporters, preferably lots of them.<br />
<br />
From Aramis:<br />
<br />
""Here is the difference between a project that is not very innovative and one that is highly innovative. A project is called innovative if the number of actors that have to be taken into account is not a given from the outset. If that number is known in advance, in contrast, the project can follow quite orderly, hierarchical phases; it can go from office to office, and every office will add the concerns of the actors for which it is responsible. As you proceed along the corridor, the size or degree of reality grows by regular increments. Research projects, on the other hand, do not have such an elegant order: the crowds that were thought to be behind the project disappear without a word; or, conversely, unexpected allies turn up and demand to be taken into account.""","03/04/09 02:27:14",0,"64.81.49.227"

But my thoughts on the album are tied intricately with my initial aversion to it a decade ago.  After the experiment of Zooropa, I think a lot of people were hoping for something more ""U2"" - which Pop clearly wasn't.  Myself included.  <br />
<br />
In retrospect, Pop sounds so much better because it has soul.  It doesn't sound like a gutless cash grab that U2's last three albums clearly are.  <br />

In small markets like here (PGH) the national/world section is not written by the newspapers staff.  This same principal applies to local television news.  They get all their story ideas from the local newspaper, and go visit with a camera and resell the 'news.'  <br />
<br />
You never hear that local news stations are failing, do you?  Usually you get three nearly identical, pretty boring ones in each city.

and the ellen tigh resurrection wasn't all writhing and moaning, it was more pain, panic and crying, and then acceptance as she remembers she's not ellen tigh anymore or even human, she's a cylon. if you missed the nuances of that scene, then you are probably missing a lot of the nuances of the show.<br />
<br />
i could probably write a whole lot about the rape issue on the show, but i'll address the helena cain/gina issue. helena is gay, the 6 named gina that she fell in love with betrayed her and got a large number of people on her ship killed. cain is not exactly a stable and healthy person, and since cylons killed her entire family, and a few billion others, what she let happen is the worst thing she personally could have done to gina. and eventually she is killed by gina for it. this is also a person who stripped civilian ships for parts and people and left the rest to die, so cain is not the best at making correct moral decisions. she's there to show what could have happened to the fleet is adama wasn't the leader, he would never let either of those things happen.<br />

If I can't find it in my format of choice, I'll even suffer through a horrid pdf if that's all they've got, though you don't see those much anymore.  So I understand why ebooks are popular. I just don't understand why they didn't take off much sooner, and I don't understand why Kindle makes them more appealing.<br />
<br />
Some people say they wouldn't want to read on a Palm-sized screen. I was worried about that too on my first book, and forgot that concern almost immediately. Once you're in the story or text, the medium becomes transparent - and I'm not someone who would want to read a book on a regular computer screen - I tried it and didn't like it. Others worry about glare - that's a legit concern, but only if you're outside on a bright day, which I almost never am when reading. Others say the text is too small, but you can make it the same size as a print book or even larger. Others worry about the battery, but my smartphone sits on the charger every night anyway. And most people just didn't want or need a Palm-type device back in Palm's heyday. So for them it would have been just another unnecessary gizmo. That makes sense, or did.<br />
<br />
But now that more and more phones have operating systems that can handle documents and ebooks, the Kindle makes even less sense. We finally have convergence to varying degrees and levels of quality - phone, Palm/whatever, camera, mp3 player, voice recorder, video camera, video player, etc., all in one device. There's no reason to have more than one device anymore, except perhaps cost, which continues to fall, and maybe camera quality, which hasn't quite caught up yet at least in most US models.  And these phones/handhelds fit in your pocket, so they can go everywhere with you, ready to read wherever you are if you find a spare moment - cafe, waiting room, work meeting, etc.<br />
<br />
With the Kindle, you get some of the same benefits of ebook-on-handheld, such as being able to carry a library around with you and not having to keep up with and store lots of hard copy books. Except a handheld fits in your pocket - no bag or hands needed, and is with you wherever you go already.  And you get some advantages over handhelds such as glareless electronic paper and more screen real estate, which is nice... when you stop what you're doing and take it out of whatever you're carrying it in and have a reading session (contrast to the handheld that you view on the fly anywhere and doesn't require any planning or remembering or baggage). And you get some things that seem like they ought to be advantages at first glance, but are kind of superfluous.  For example, being able to buy a book directly from the unit is an advantage of sorts, but how often has a book purchase been so urgent that that having instant access is solving a problem, given how accessible the web already is via computer? And being able to check your email is in theory an advantage, but you can very easily do that already via computer or handheld, and both of those do it better, and one of them fits in your pocket and neither of them costs you another $360.  Newspaper delivery, too, would seem to be an advantage, except that you probably already sit at a computer for hours a day anyway and get your news that way.<br />
<br />
So I think it's a great device that is fundamentally crippled by the fact that it can't go everywhere with you (unless you carry a purse/murse everywhere) and the fact that you've already got something that goes everywhere with you anyway that you can read books on - your phone or handheld.  To put a finer point on it - it's not that the Kindle <em>can't</em> go everywhere with you - I mean, it's wafer-thin and light - just that it <em>won't</em>. And for that reason, aside from being duplicative and unnecessary, it just won't get used as much as it would if it could fit in your pocket.  If they make a model that will fold to a quarter of its current size... and do my PIM functions for me... and texting and email... and web browsing... and have a camera/camcorder... and play mp3s.... and make phone calls, I'll totally get one. Wait! Already got one!  I think the release of the Kindle iPhone app was the recognition of all of the above.  I think the standalone unit itself will ultimately be a niche novelty or else evolve into a pocket-sized, full-featured smartphone/handheld.","03/24/09 21:49:44",0,"71.203.164.151"

It's more the new web browser, and less the new joost. Its aim is to point to available content, rather than strike up deals. And, since it's done in a better interface than Miro and works better with Hulu, that means some nerds can throw away their cable box.<br />
<br />
The point isn't where its at now, the point is the future. Briefly, last year, you and I talked about this idea of needing a ""player"" so we wouldn't be doing quicktime vs real in a few years (like we are with Flash vs Move Networks.) With Boxee, we're getting there. Middleware providers won't have to fight to get their content compatible with their player, instead they'll release something that's compatible with Boxee (and XBMC, and a host of other apps) and Voila, standards based delivery of video content over the internet to a TV.<br />

It <em>is</em> about interface, but interface is about access to content. Front Row / Apple TV only lets you play your iTunes/Quicktime friendly content. No Netflix/Hulu video, no weird-codec AVIs. Boxee lets you get to those. It effectively minimizes the distinction between content on your HD and content you stream through a service. And in many cases, just like the iPhone clients are better than regular web sites, the Boxee client/interface is a better browsing experience than the default web browser. <br />

The real question might be, why Boxee and why not Plex or XBMC or any of the other forks out there.

1) yes, most would be 'social media experts' are douchebags who rather than innovate, exploit<br />

2) also, most 'social media experts' aren't actually marketers or strategists or even really understand the whole kool aid of ""markets are conversations"" (which has far more reaching implications than being simply a passing hype in the late 90's...again, data Web, data Web, data Web...changes everything) social media?

<br />
3) no, spamming social networks and using it purely for self-indulgent promotion and spam is ridiculous and so-called ""experts"" will die off<br />
<br />
4) what's wrong with this premise is the idea that social media is somehow some separate from the Web itself. Its not, its a prelude to the next iterative states of the Web (dare i mention Semantic Web?)...we've moved from linked documents to linked RIAs and we will be moving on to linked data...and the most important data? social data...your information and profile data will provide social context to just about any site or service (even the search engines)...and that's what's exciting. interoperability. and intuitive, socially contextual Web experiences based on your behaviorial, personal and relatioship data. scary? nah...AWESOME<br />

** because if he literally did do that (or, did ""doodoo"" it), then that would probably lead him to to write a posthuman manifesto entitled ""against digestion,"" which would argue that, contrary to what you may believe, the process of digestion is actually an affront to the <a href=""http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fundament"" target=""_blank"">fundament</a>s of the american democratic system (w/r/t to both the historically unfair and unequal rates at which different ""breeds"" of foodstuffs are broken down and passed through the striations of the ascending colon*** AND the affront to basic human rights that the expulsion of noxious intestinal gas causes, perhaps in an inspired bit of rhetorical gamesmanship comparing these ""silent but deadly"" attacks to the use of tear gas to break up anti-WTO protests) and would conclude that this process of digestion should be stopped immediately by anyone and everyone who truly cares about living a virtuous and intellectual life.<br />

<br />
This results in them having social capital in this very early, intermediary stage where, in the old/new media balance, the power lies firmly in the former. I guess I'm saying that 'celebs taking over Twitter' might be the clash between old-media, capital-based social capital (awkward, I know) to a more micro-celeb, new-media social capital that operates in a manner less constrained by wealth. Sure, Oprah will have a fuckload of followers and Kutcher 'won' whatever the fuck he won, but Oprah won't continue to tweet b/c her wealth-based capital won't sustain her when it can't translate to the 'very social' social capital of a network like Twitter. <br />
<br />
I also don't quite get the celebrities take over Twitter argument - it's not a push service and the closest one is forced to dealing with it in the aggregate comes in the form of the retweet. I might just be committed to it though.<br />

There are all of these culturally conservative media types (especially here in new york) who are hanging dearly to a style -- or more specifically, to the ideas they've built up over the past few years of how online publishing should work. Their resistance to social media is pure frustration -- they had mastered a craft, blogging, which had started to find a defined, fixed style (a one-to-many publishing style, no less), but it was now being challenged by all this <em>conversation</em>. The confusion is exactly that -- the collision of <em>communication</em> and <em>publishing</em>.<br />

<br />
Can this be my shift memo? Cuz I have returned from The Land of Over-Thinking, a gloomy place somewhere between the basement of the old Kim's Video and that empty lot on Broome where that supercondo never rose from. And I have finally, regrettably devised some almost, nearly cohesive thoughts about what I might possibly, haphazardly say.<br />
<br />
With hedging adverbs.<br />
<br />
But first, it's fun, right? It looks fun! This hey-these-are-things-that-intrigue-us quality -- I know this aesthetic very well!<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is more unsolicited than an STD, but my curiosity about The Awl centers on two contradictory questions:<br />
<br />
1) Is it too broad?<br />
<br />
2) Is it too narrow?<br />
<br />
Ohhhh, smack! You can't win!<br />
<br />
Before I elaborate, allow me to say I REALLY LIKE the site. And as you once said to me about the microframe piece, <em>not in an underminey way!</em> I guess I'm asking: <em>does this work as a publication?</em> Um, does that mean <em>business?</em> Errrr... sorry! Maybe. But let me mistakenly try to elaborate on each:<br />
<br />
1) I'll use Kottke as my example here, though it might as well be BoingBoing or early Gawker or whatever. The point is, no matter what one thinks of Jason's long-standing project, he's done something remarkable from the perspective of voice. It's broad, yet it's singular. Almost every day, I encounter some webpage where I think, ""I could link to this, but it's actually more of a Kottke thing."" And you know what? He's usually already got it! My point is not about speed, but rather that Jason has created a unique space out of his catholic taste (""liberal arts 2.0"" -- whoa! that's like <em>college</em> broad!). But here's the important thing: Jason's <em>actual</em> personal tastes are even broader than what his site suggests. (Well, I only kinda know him, not super well, but either way I get this sense.) After all, he works out of the BuzzFeed offices, and much of that baloney (baloney I like!) must interest him, no? But he refrains from letting all of his interests spill out onto the site. (As you can tell, I admire this quality because I completely lack it! I let my id, ego, or super ego all have a shot! And it's why my dumb site is so stupidly miscellaneous. Jason's site is about lots of things but is still about <em>something</em>.) What am I saying? Apprehensively, I ask whether The Awl needs more definition than ""everything we like."" I disagree with whoever said above that there's too much -- for me, and I suspect for the business, it's really just more about <em>focus</em>. (I'm prepared for the counter-argument: are Daily Beast, Metafilter, Suck, or New York Mag ""about"" something? I think the answer is <em>yes</em>, despite being more topically diverse, they somehow still feel more... defined.)<br />
<br />
2) A friend of mine just returned from Foo Camp. I asked if anyone brought up the launch of The Awl out in Cali. Of course not. <em>Okay so not fair!</em> Appealing to crunchy nerds in tents should not be on the demographic target list! But that doesn't mean there isn't some sort of, ya know, imagined reader out there. And I'm not quite sure I see that person yet, but the glimpse of him/her is exclusively a New Yorker. <em>I know, I know, so is a lot of stuff!</em> Or is it? I have friends in Minneapolis who read Gawker (even ""old Gawker"") and friends in LA who read The New Yorker. But I -- cringe, ouch -- somehow don't see any of them reading The Awl, which right now feels even more New Yorky than Gothamist and The Observer. (Part of it, I hate to say, is that high school insidery stuff in the comments. Or maybe that's good? Did camaraderie help Gawker commenting? Is it like when Pavement made inside jokes to their fans? I don't know. Maybe?)<br />
<br />
Oh, and finally, all of this is COMPLETELY UNFAIR CRITICISM. Seriously, the site's been live for, what 48 hours?<br />
<br />
And I get that you want it to feel somewhat miscellaneous -- a wide collection of stuff that ""people who are smart"" care about. But is the content net too diverse? I can see the criticism of this already -- <em>just do what you like and really show it and people will admire it</em>. I think Merlin said that in Austin a couple months ago. He's right, huh? Okay, maybe I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
And seriously, why did I just jerk off Jason like that? Next time I'll think of something mean to say.<br />
<br />
Probably jealous,<br />

23543,6041,"BradOFarrell",,"I dunno if I get the premise of the survey. Sometimes Colbert is joking, and sometimes he's joking that he's joking, depending on the topic. Colbert's character is blindly conservative, but the writing staff isn't blindly liberal, so they're not going to always make him 'wrong' 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
Colbert's character is flexible enough to where he can advocate any view point through satire. If he's advocating a left wing view point he acts as a straw man, and if he's advocating a right wing or centrist viewpoint he does it by just making a valid argument while being funny. I mean, most of the time the 'intent' is coming from the left, but there are rare occasions where it's not, depending on the subject.<br />
<br />
Mike Judge does a similar thing with King of the Hill, since the show's characters are more conservative than the writers. Usually the satirical episodes land on the left, but not all of the time.<br />
<br />
It's just weird that the survey asks if he's doing one or the other all of the time, because they do both. But they obviously make him a straw man like 95% of the time, and he's only ""joking about joking"" like 5% of the time. So people would still be wrong in saying that he's ""joking about joking"" all the time, but it's still a dumb question.<br />

Why should we want to ""save the media?""  Why should we even care?<br />
<br />
Is there any special reason why newspapers or magazines should survive? Is it because if people don't pay for content, there won't be any good content?<br />
<br />
That's a preposterous notion. I can get fabulous content about the Supreme Court from SCOTUSblog -- I don't need Nina Totenberg or Linda Greenhouse to mediate for me. I certainly don't need the Supreme Court reporter for Time, Newsweek, or, heaven forbid, The San Francisco Chronicle.<br />
<br />
As for local news? Well, not to worry. There will be folks taking up the slack there; there will be plenty of local bloggers with exceptional insight who will hold the feet of the local city council to the fire. War reporting? Thomas Ricks and John Burns will always find an audience. So will Michael Yon and Michael Totten.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I thought Shirky's article was excellent except for one assertion -- that we need ""journalism.""<br />
<br />
No, we don't. We don't need innumerate politically-slanted generalist mediators filtering ideas for us. We need EXPERTS talking to us directly. THAT's why Dan Rather and Mary Mapes and Eason Jordan were exposed for the frauds they were...because EXPERTS, not amateurs, were brought to bear on the problem.<br />

And they're out there in every subject area including yours--technology.<br />

The do have the resources, even in their current fragile state, to do exceptional work in both hard factual reporting and true in-depth analysis. And there are some good reporters there. <br />

But the crap they put out continues to amaze. The New York Times should have on staff the smartest, most careful writers in the nation but who do they have?

Right. I think of it as the last gasp of fad-culture. That's why it's still tough to say something looks/sounds like it's from the 90s. We were losing the sort of pop culture we've had since the 40s. Sure, music companies capitalized on ""alternative"" and movie companies capitalized on the slacker flicks or whatever was popular that year & but media companies lost the ability to dictate culture. If capitalizing means taking advantage of and pumping money into -- then big media companies lost the ability to do either to the same extent as they had previously.

Nostalgia makes for some interesting retread entertainment. Specifically, its what we would now call ""remixes"" in music - not authentic or original, but using a prior idea in a new meme. Listening to Led Zeppelin albums (timeless they are) in your college dorm room in 1998 is not nostalgia.

24002,6136,"sabf","http://songsaboutbuildingsandfood.wordpress.com/","<em>Pitchmen</em> is like a fucking magic trick of rhetoric and branding.  Each episode is basically just an infomercial for the informercials being filmed within it -- it's just an infomercial wrapped in the form of an hour-long Discovery Channel show instead of a quick-cut, one and a half minute whambamthankyoumaam sell-off.  In a way, it's the exact opposite of Mythbusters -- it's Myth Creators.  On the surface, the show is purporting to let us in on these myths of pitching, to show us the secrets of salesmanship, but mostly it's just salesmanship in and of itself, of the products in each episode and of the pitchmen themselves.  Despite this, though, the pitchmen's credibility isn't diminished by their constant selling of their selling; actually, their ethical appeal and credibility are enhanced because we keep seeing all these scenes of them ""working"" so hard and worrying about their integrity, constantly telling us and showing us in scenes (often involving ""real people"" just like me and you) how they're ""making sure"" that they only sell products that are high quality and useful and properly priced.  Because of all this meta-selling, the versions of them that are seen in the actual infomercials become much more credible to the Pitchmen viewer because we have this view of them working in the ""real"" world, we ""know them,"" they're ""good guys.""  Plus, even if people don't watch the show, the simple fact of Billy and Sully's (wow, I'm on a first name basis with them so I know I can trust them) presence on a well-shot, major cable television show (on the Discovery channel, no less, with its signifiers of ""science"" and ""truth"") grows their name recognition and public perception and makes them something else besides just salesmen in a way that definitely strengthens their brand.  What's even more amazing is, despite all this, despite the fact that we're watching a show with no commercial breaks, a show that's basically <em>all</em> commercial, the whole thing is still pretty funny and entertaining, partially because of the process angle (ala Mythbusters) but mostly because the pitchmen are interesting and fun and relatable, which is probably why people enjoy buying their stupid crap, people including, I guess, me.","05/25/09 15:49:47",0,"216.189.181.85"

<br />
The Pop aspect of GaGa sort of overwhelms the Weird. What's Weird about her is that she seems so okay with that. Pop is art, art is life, life is sex, sex is fashion, fashion is Pop... that's it. Not original, blah, blah, but she's good at it. <br />
<br />
Barney uses the Weird to kind of excuse himself for anything resembling Pop. Bjork uses that device as bit as well.. screaming and grunting and sound-scaping so that no one mistakes her good looks and musical gifts for a packageable product. <br />
<br />
They both go for something epic... but I'm thinking that Barneyism is kind of GaGa's kryptonite. She's trying to get laid and paid by really good looking people. Using art and stuff.<br />
<br />
Barney is trying to get very heady people horny about art. He wants to get laid and paid intellectually. <br />
<br />
GaGa wants to fuck with the body and Barney wants to fuck with the mind. I think there are black hole issues preventing a collaboration. Arts/Culture universe would implode.<br />

That's what happened with Google from my perspective. I just remember hearing ""it's so much better"" back in my Yahoo days. There was an almost Apple-like shiny shiny cachet stylishness to the buzz about it and about identifying as a Google user. Curious, I checked it out, it worked fine, and I liked the clean and simple interface. I don't know that I really noticed that my searching was any better, but I stuck with it. Maybe it was the silly name. I don't think the bulk of users recognize that there are things Google can't or doesn't find. We non-sophisticated users seem to get by well enough with what it does find and don't really think about what else might be possible. Sad, surely, but I thin also true. So in regard to adopting a new search engine, it seems like it will be hard to convince many people why they should even bother checking it out unless it becomes the cool thing to do.

<br />
I am taking this slightly offtopic and tl;dr to a thought I'd like for you to consider, because it is ultimately why people whine about the loss of ""journalism"": Take your average writer, reporter, etc. They work full-time and make an average salary. Ignore for a second the will of the subject (that is, whether or not they WANT TO switch careers), and consider that it is incredibly difficult for anyone to switch careers and basically start over in a new line of work. It's a massive pay downgrade and it is still a struggle to land an entry-level position without relevant experience. You're competing with college grads and former interns, and employers rush to deign you overqualified. So, there is a major labor transition issue at play here. <br />
<br />
There are strong forces in the economy right now that is causing this issue to occur in a lot of industries. Like the broker who doesn't have a financial industry to go back to, the industrial robotics worker who doesn't have an auto industry to go back to, the Java coder who can only find Ruby-on-Rails jobs. These people have already invested years of their time into training, and their entire line of work is shrinking while evolving. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if there were decent jobs these people could run to. We are finding out right now what happens when this sort of thing happens to an economy on a mass scale, and not in just one sector at a time. And there is absolutely no plan for handling this in a sufficient manner.<br />

I'm sorry, basically Free now. It would also get all the young pirating hipsters more likely to pay for their horrible music, because the price point is low enough and they get the added convenience, audio quality and extras like liner notes or whatever other media the music industry should be offering.<br />

<br />
At the same time, the ridiculous, almost infinite wealth of good photography online means that it must be really really hard to be a pro photographer. So... yeah, probably. You'll soon get a very tiny slice of people who will be able to call themselves writers, and those people will have to be exceptionally, unusually good. <br />

Keep in mind, you've been deeply involved with the web and the way it works for a long time. Knowing this ""common-sense"" stuff doesn't just come naturally for anybody who starts a website.<br />
<br />
I'll agree that plenty of it does seem like common sense. Having a good CMS certainly helps--but many, many small businesses have never heard of ANY CMS, let alone the SEO nuances of custom Drupal or Wordpress builds. Having good copywriters on staff helps even more--but the same applies here... most sites write the same stuff for the web that they'd write on a brochure. Just 2 examples, of course.<br />
<br />
So it's a package of basic skills that are greater than their parts, but it's also doing research on things like staying up on Google's whims. Google changes its own rules all the time, and SEOs have to keep up with it. Google's nofollow tag rules changed pretty dramatically within the past year, for instance.<br />

But writing, as a professional service for a company or commercial operation, is no longer a viable career. And there are factors involved that have nothing to do with ad revenue or profit models - some of it is a consequence of the runaway cost of living in the US. It does still pay, but it pays less in a society where things cost so much more. Now only the rich can afford it.<br />
<br />
As it is with so many things now. The public is only aware of the people who are in a crisis now after years of sliding toward the abyss. What no one is looking at is that nearly everyone else is sliding toward that abyss too - unless something fundamental changes in the way that the American economy is managed. We cannot all buy luxury goods, make every management decision to best enhance quarterly reports, and play bubble games with equities, derivatives, commodities and physical assets. This would be painful and uncomfortable, so the most resourceful among us are instead trying to avoid that change by throwing the weakest people overboard. Layoffs and foreclosures/evictions and tanked credit scores and denial of healthcare. That will solve everything! <br />

The crisis and the internet are  thinning the professional herd in those areas.<br />
<br />
Also, journalism as a profession has been affected in the US by a persistent left-leaning bias, and now that people have more options they no longer care for the likes of the NYT, CNN, Newsweek etc because they do not trust or identify themselves w/ their liberal agenda. I'm constantly amazed at the lack of political self-awareness of journalists who are clearly leftists but think of themselves as impartial reporters etc etc. <br />

Finally, journalists were in a privileged position to see the current crisis approaching. Whoever sat pretty and simply hoped against hope lacked good sense and initiative. <br />

""The Onion's march into the mainstream continues. A satirical newspaper published in Wisconsin and on the Web, The Onion can no longer be considered just a cult hit. Its first book, Our Dumb Century, debuted at No. 26 on the extended New York Times best seller list; next week it jumps to No. 9, according to its publisher, Three Rivers Press. In other Onion news, former editor Ben Karlin, who had ventured to Los Angeles to write pilots and episodes of Cartoon Network's Space Ghost: Coast to Coast, has become the new senior producer at The Daily Show With Jon Stewart, replacing head writer Chris Kreski (who's moving to Martin Short's syndicated talk show, now in the early stages over at King World). Another Onion alum, David Javerbaum, recently left Late Show With David Letterman to try his hand athuh?musical theater.""<br />

""Giving viewers relief from all that, perhaps, will be the editors and writers of The Onion, a satirical newspaper published in Wisconsin (and available on the Web). According to Onion manager David Miner of 3 Arts Entertainment in New York, The Onion is near a deal with NBC to produce a series of specials, the first of which would be called Our Dumb Century . They're talking a fall '99 air date. As of press time, Onion editor Scott Dikkers was scheduled to have a meeting in New York with Conan O'Brien and his producer, Jeff Ross. The pairing of The Onion and Late Night With Conan O'Brien makes sense: Both have a gleefully absurd take on the world, and Mr. O'Brien is an Onion fan.""<br />

Now there's something we can probably all agree with, yet no one ever seems to accomplish it. Soup (may I call you Soup?), I'm curious if you have any ideas on how this might work.

I know you're being somewhat dismissive of the blog format but the nature of a news site is to remain fresh. You want to have the newest content up front.

The best example of this is Drudge. His site is complete info overload below the fold. But I go to his site first if something big happens. Many people do the same, and I guess some more people hit that site daily or hourly to scan the big stories.

24743,6263,"Eric",,"I really think you've managed to make horizontal scanning work in a vertical setting. The order that my eyes go through the stories is the order you wanted because it's how my eyes have been trained to work. Yet it doesn't cross the line into horrific Wonderwall territory of horizontal scrolling (crossing my fingers that wasn't one of yours). Biggest biggie at the top and then large -> medium -> small stories horizontally in the next sections down. It's like reading lines in a book - left to right scan, skip down, left to right scan. Very natural.<br />
<br />
The section dividers are prominent enough to divide and identify content yet blend in enough that they don't jump out to compete. They keep me inside a thematic zone, blocking out the higher and lower stuff temporarily until I'm ready for it. It's very easy to consume, and in fact encourages me to read each link in each section. No other newsy front page does that for me. Contrast to HuffPo, bastard child of MySpace, where my eyes go all ADD trying to scan content of variable size misaligned across multiple columns as I scroll down, missing stuff left and right because of the pace I want to keep, or the carnival/yard sale layout of a lot of front pages. You're lucky to only have a handful of categories, which keeps things simple and tidy.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the nonwhite background. It's easy on the eyes. To make the site even easier on my particular eyes, I forced sans serif in my browser. The bolded, italicized, blue serif text in particular was giving me scattery eye interference. Sweet, sweet Helvetica. Goes nicely with the design theme.<br />
<br />
If you're collecting/considering layman feedback for possible tweaking, here's some:<br />
<br />
I'm not the site's target audience, but it seems like if you're someone who is interested in the Power Grid rankings, then one of your main user tasks on the site is to quickly determine who has risen, who has fallen, and then get the context, namely how much they rose or fell and why. Currently I don't see previous ranking context or any explanation of the cause for a given move, though granted it's only the second day. Makes the ranking system seem opaque and therefore arbitrary, despite the FAQ explanation of what is measured. I could rank these people if I wanted to and move them up and down at will but nobody would have any reason to buy it. Likewise for you guys. Why should anyone trust your rankings and movements? Couldn't you put a thumb on the scale so to speak, particularly if it was lucrative for the site owners in some way, and then hide behind the mysterious algorithm? Not that you would, just that there's nothing to give people confidence that it won't happen. Even if the risk of somebody manually tracking you from day to day to find irregularities means you'd never do it, it would just win people's confidence immediately if you were clear about what drove the moves.<br />
<br />
Transparency and intentions aside, rankings movements seem useless minus context and history. Does a green up arrow mean somebody jumped one spot or 20? Where were they yesterday and last month? Listing the previous ranking, and maybe even a graph of historical rankings, would not only make today's ranking meaningful but wouldn't give away anything proprietary. Still though, if somebody jumps or drops five spots one day, I'd like to know why. If four to six metrics go into a person's ranking, which ones changed, or changed most notably to cause the movement? Did circulation nosedive? Did they do something to send Googlers into a frenzy? Isn't this what people ultimately want to know? Help me, or rather your users, understand and value the information and possibly make use of it in a supportable way. ""According to media-ranking site Mediaite, So and So's star is on the rise due to xyz...""  Otherwise I have to go do the homework myself and you may not get credit. If somebody's Google buzz is 10,000 today, for example, could there be a smaller line of text under it that says ""(up 20% since yesterday)"" or ""(up 2,000 since yesterday)"" or similar? You could click it for a historical chart, just as with the main rank figure. Then you really become a comprehensive and convenient intel center.<br />
<br />
In regard to the Power Grid preview block on the front page, I'm not clear on why any two people appear there. Is it just a random pluck of people from a given featured category? Today it's #3-stationary and #7-falling, for example. If it's random, I'm thinking it hasn't quite earned its place on the front page. What if instead the biggest riser and biggest faller regardless of category were featured each day? As on personal pages, you could say ""#7 among Magazine Editors"" so people wouldn't think the two people on the front page were necessarily ranked against each other. For additional differentiation you could superimpose miniature versions of the category icons over the corner of each headshot to make it clear what industry each person is in. Or there's room for another line of text under their names for their category names instead. Given the extra real estate in that area, what if the person on the right were scooted leftward, and in the newly-freed up space to the right, the next biggest movers were listed in a small text-only way with little bitty colored ASCII arrows? At that point the preview section becomes useful, timely news-at-a-glance every day and invites further exploration of the Grid. If the ranking feature is what really sets this site apart, that would be a way to further highlight its relevance and dynamic nature on the front page. I could have the premise of the preview area wrong of course.<br />
<br />
Minor personal point - I know it's common, but I don't see the point of link lists anymore assuming they're there for me and not some other business purpose. I never use them because I don't care what other sites a given site thinks I might want. And if I already visit any of those sites, I'll get there via my usual route. If it instead has some kind of traffic trading purpose for the business or SEO courtesy, or if I'm abnormal in my non-usage, then I understand.","07/07/09 12:44:49",0,"12.45.218.194"

Champion's criticism is that Baker is being elitist, which sort of leaves me scratching my head. It's elitist to write a negative review of an expensive electronic gizmo?

Nail in coffin number one. Jump to iTunes and Amazon and you can hear clips.<br />
Nail in coffin number two.  In those same places, you can read what others are saying.  Even if the individual reviews are trite, the overall picture is valuable.<br />
Nail in coffin number three. Aggregators like MetaCritic change the way people look at reviews.  It's no longer based on pub, but based and criticized right next to multiple sources.<br />
Nail in coffin number four. Entertainment journalism is quite bad nowadays which the article alludes to. But nowadays one can really step back and realize how much purple prose and nonsense populates most average reviews.<br />
Nail in coffin number five.  Even if you don't download items illegally, a blog that does will happily review and provide tracks to listen or download.<br />
<br />
The scene has just changed.  It used to be required in the 1980s to grab a copy of the Village Voice (for example) to keep up on what's new.  Now?  Who cares.<br />

And yes, the platform for logical thoughtful criticism is dying.  But the entry point to getting a blog or review published on Amazon is zero.  The days of making a life off of it are dead/dying, but I think I really appreciate pop culture being more accessible.<br />

I haven't met Scarlett Johansson, but I know exactly what type of person she is:<br />
Her then BF (now BFF) Josh Hartnett brought her to his family's swanky Lake of the Isles home in Minneapolis some years back for the holidays.  As a joke, to make her feel welcome, the family got a copy of People magazine with her on the cover for each person in the house.  As the famous couple walked in, everyone had their noses buried in a gossip mag and glared skeptically at the couple.<br />
<br />

Well, I never established a beginning of the relationship.  Your assumption that I implied this trip was her first (to meet the family) is logically fallacious.  To wit, the fact that GossipCop (and the rest of us) exists now isn't proof that the big bang didn't happen, but rather the opposite: evidence of myriad chains of events culminating in the visceral present.  <br />

25358,6357,"Nav","http://scrawledinwax.com","Hm. What if imitating the avante-garde is the only choice? That it's the repetition of it, rather than the innovation, that becomes important? <br />
<br />
To truly be avante-garde would be to 'push boundaries' - but what would that even mean? To be shocking? To be outlandish? To wear ball-gowns from the '20's with AK-47's attached to the belt? What boundaries, either aesthetic or social, would be left to cross?<br />
<br />
I think the problem is that to push something forward requires some kind of boundary line that would allow you to see the 'progress'. I'm not sure that's possible any more. <br />
<br />
But it just occurred to me: what if it's the break or gap between Lady GaGa and whoever that person under the schtick is that's actually the avante-garde here - a return (but not) to fame that isn't the public embodiment of an identity but public display of a made-up character. Celebrity as conscious, self-reflexive 'acting', rather than the more common attempts to hide it.","08/12/09 11:37:31",0,"70.26.85.75"

<br />
I think there are absolutely still boundary lines, and still opportunities for progress. They're hard to see; they've always been hard to see.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons I mentioned China is that I think one of our big boundaries has to do with political & moral assumptions -- the assumption of democracy, for instance. I could imagine a Chinese writer or artist making a strong, sustained case against it -- a sort of anti-Locke of the 21st century -- and <br />
<br />
You could also probably push some boundaries with biology, along two dimensions: food, and self-modification. Food is more obvious -- and I'm surprised compelling talk about food (what it is, where it comes from, whether or not we kill animals to get it) hasn't been the subject of more compelling (non-lame) art. Self-modification is a big one -- you see little examples of it here and there, and some of it does rely on the shock factor, for sure. But this is gonna be a new frontier soon, if it isn't already, and jeez, talking about making a sacrifice for your art. ""Yeah, I injected myself with octopus DNA... now I can make my skin change color. The downside is that I now smell like an octopus.""<br />
<br />
Those might all be silly examples (they're just off the top of my head) -- but I am 100% convinced there is an avant-garde, and the fact that it's not immediately identifiable -- iconic -- almost proves my point ;-)","08/12/09 13:32:30",0,"4.78.248.3"

What I was referring to was the position of the avante-garde in a culture: it used to refer to the cutting-edge, the new, the provocative, to act as a marker of what might be coming. But take, I dunno, Dead Prez: their first disc strongly advocated a kind of neo-Marxism; but, like everything else, it was just one more voice, one more perspective. The cutting-edge blurs so quickly into the present that it's hard to see avante-garde in the same light - or, perhaps more accurately, imbue it with the same transformative potential.<br />
<br />
But I like your examples and your last paragraph. What I'm wondering is if the avante-garde will have to become bodily precisely to avoid its subsumption into the same circles of discourse - oh, it's just that, it just means this same old thing. It's what Derrida characterised as the difference between futur, the future that inevitably comes out of the present, and l'avenir, the thing to come that cannot be predicted, precisely because it's <em>different</em> in the grand, radical sense of the word.","08/12/09 18:34:57",0,"99.248.81.113"

<br />
1.  I used to expend a lot of creative energy (ex. <a href=""http://songsaboutbuildingsandfood.wordpress.com/2009/03/12/redacted-ex-machina/"" target=""_blank"">1</a>) trying to defend these kind of people from what I thought was unjust and reflexive criticism of them but, you know, fuck that shit, I give up.  I thought maybe that they were really valuable as like exaggerated metaphors for the paradoxes of contemporary humanity and existence or whatever and, you know, they probably <em>are</em>, but a lot of them also just seem to be gross and unpleasant in a lot of ways that turn me off, though of course as a ""blogger"" and ""online person"" I am in some sense one of them and so can't criticize them too much without seeing the same faults in myself.<br />
<br />
2.  The binary that Jakob (or ""Jake,"" scusi, love that folksy rebrand!) proposes in his post above kind of reminds me of when Hipster Runoff did that <a href=""http://www.hipsterrunoff.com/2009/01/animal-collective-is-a-band-created-byforon-the-internet.html"" target=""_blank"">big Animal Collective post</a> and then Nick Silvester wrote <a href=""http://www.riffmarket.com/2009/01/re-hipster-runoffs-animal-collective.html"" target=""_blank"">his own big response</a> on Riff Market.  Near the end of his essay/rant/manifesto, he proposed a binary which basically said that either ""YOU CAN DANCE"" or you can ""blow up the hospital,"" which I think was supposed to mean that in this world you can be either sincere and loving and support things/people or insincere and nihilistic and destroy things/people, although to tell you the truth I got kind of confused with his references to <em>The Dark Knight</em> and so maybe I've got that wrong.  Anyway, what I remember thinking after reading the two posts is that all they did was make me more sure of the fact that simplistic binaries of this sort are mostly useless.  I agreed with a lot of the sentiments that Nick Silvester expressed in his post and I think it's important to try to generally be as open and sincere as you possibly can (I had even written a somewhat similar and expansive post about ""<a href=""http://songsaboutbuildingsandfood.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/dancing-wrt-architecture/"" target=""_blank"">DANCING</a>""), and yet at the same time I found the way Nick Sylvester expressed his sentiments to be pretty histrionic and ridiculous and rhetorically messy.  Hipster Runoff sometimes feels so shallow and mean that it makes me sad and uncomfortable, but at the same time I think it's some of the very best medium-essentialist art that's being created on the Internet today and I think that Animal Collective post, however nihilistic it may be, is a lot more valuable and beautiful and complex than Nick Sylvester's response to it was.  As both Julia Allison and our president were <a href=""http://songsaboutbuildingsandfood.wordpress.com/2008/03/18/why-do-you-build-me-up-buttercup-just-to-let-me-down/"" target=""_blank"">once</a> fond of saying, though, life doesn't have to be a zero-sum game, it doesn't have to be an either-or proposition.<br />
<br />
3. Dear commenter ""Tal"" -- Rex is interesting and funny and Jakob is whatever but they are not Benjamin Franklin, OMFG, are you serious?!  Benjamin Franklin invented the lightning rod and bifocals and the Franklin stove and opened the country's first library and fire department and helped maintain the strong diplomatic ties with France that, you know, helped make the American Revolution possible (I looked all this up on Wikipedia!).  Rex and Jakob invented Gossip Cop and Mediaite and, most notably, a site on which high definition music videos can sometimes be watched.  These things are not equal to each other (no offense love U Rex).  <br />

I'm interested in the psychology of why the above doesn't happen more. We can just move on, but we don't. Through experience, I've gotten a lot better at just moving on, but still feel the need to chime in sometimes. Why bother? Change the channel. Jakob's diagnosis of the impulse sounds like one formed from a position of hurt, and it's not accurate for me. The answer is something related to this <a href=""http://xkcd.com/386/"">xkcd </a>comic about someone being ""wrong"" on the internet. I'm interested in the impulse that says I have to correct someone, put someone in their place, snark something down. Why not just move on? Is it some kind of collective self-correction that is actually beneficial in shaping better behavior? A scarlet letter squad? Is it a control issue paired with egocentrism? Because it's this nagging feeling that wants to be assuaged like a neurotic compulsion. What do I get out of it? What do I feel I'll lose if I don't do it? I've figured out life is better if you just move on, but am still curious what's behind it in the first place.

<br />
With aging your group of friends both grows and slowly spins apart and services such as twitter and facebook start to become a more vital tool for communication.  At some point you simply cannot afford the resources of keeping in direct contact.  So you pick and choose; some close friends get the ""check in"" text/email or phonecall, all others get the   less resource intensive passive interaction of social networking.<br />
<br />
SMS is a much better tool if your network of friends is tighter.   One person texts the other, than they forward the text or physically show the other.  Boom your done.   Hell I remember when I was a kid, a pager was the only social network I had.<br />
<br />
Another reason for Twitters insignificance among teens I'd guess is that SMS communication doesn't require a smartphone or a data plan for an always on connection.   I could send you a direct message on twitter and hope you check in with twitter, or I could send a text and instantly know that you got it. Finally I would guess some parents are willing to get their kid a cell but aren't throwing down for the $30 a month data plan and iphone.  ","08/26/09 16:48:08",0,"75.168.118.251"

I think what you're missing is that publishers (not editors) control information on things like renewal rates and metrics, and they're often quite dedicated to not sharing that information because if they did the editor could use it as leverage to get a raise. <br />
There's often little transparency between editor and publisher because of issues like that, and also issues of the publisher trying not to/trying not to be seen as influencing the editorial side's coverage, which both upsets the editorial side and damages the brand.  <br />
So, you're right in aggregate, it is probably a strategy for suicide, but the reason behind it isn't willful arrogance and ignorance, it's probably simpler than that, merely a tradition of management keeping labor in the dark both for labor's perceived own good (not biasing them) and for management's own good (keeping labor cost down.) <br />

Thank you for your non-vested-interest mention of Mediaite. I love that Robert Quigley has both the take-on links and I have the linkbait...though my Lady Gaga fest was honestly done, more out of obsession and Thanksgiving free time than anything else (I'll def cop to linkbaiting tho). If Mediaite does nothing more than give the world Robert Quigley, though, then I'm happy. <br />

27040,6664,"Rex Manning Day",,"Nothing would have been different had the Library of Alexandria survived, for many many reasons.<br />
<br />
Among other things, most works in the Library of Alexandria were written on papyrus, and papyrus is, needless to say, not the longest-lasting substance on Earth. There's a slim possibility that, had the Library lasted longer, some of those works might have been copied, but it's unlikely. Copying documents at the time was very time- and labor-intensive, and didn't actually happen very often for most documents. So in all likelihood, even if the physical Library structure still stood today, the overwhelming majority of documents in it would have been destroyed anyway.<br />
<br />
Also, the ""Gospel of Eve"" thing hasn't caught on because it's ridiculous. Among other things, we only have two sentences of it, so even if it was worth more attention, there's nothing to study. But contrary to what the History Channel would have you believe, not all old books that call themselves ""Gospels"" are worth much attention. The ""Gospel of Eve"" was written 400 years after Christ died; it's not like it was some fundamental original text that reveals the true nature of the early Church. Unless you're really interested in obscure 5th century Gnostic cults, the Gospel of Eve isn't going to be that revelatory.","01/15/10 11:22:56",0,"63.246.208.130"

So, Scoble makes good points, but i think he's WRONG. The reason so many people are on the Twitter is that it's simple to jump in. For the internet-naive, this seems Complicated.

So, um, no.

Can you clarify which part you are calling bullshit on, though?

27504,6794,"Jaredq","http://agermanwordforthat.tumblr.com/","Well, first of all it's suspicious that the Times article itself doesn't do a very good job of explaining what pink noise actually is.  After doing five minutes of web browsing, I think the article is not saying anything more than that there is more of a pattern to shot lengths today than in the past.  One look at the graph is enough to make me suspicious that average is ""approaching"" 1/f--sure, it's getting closer, but it's still a long way off.  (Plus, that line-of-best-fit looks really weird to me.)  This is interesting, but you're right to point out that it has nothing to do with cognitive effect--despite the tone of the article.  <br />
<br />
I'm interested to read the original study, and I will when I have more time (right).  But it seems to me that before we even think about what this means for film attention, we should wait to hear what the Cinemetrics people think about this.  They're already got a huge amounts of data that can be analyzed for this.  http://www.cinemetrics.lv/database.php<br />
<br />
For more on average shot length, and how it's getting shorter, you can also look at David Bordwell's The Way Hollywood Tells It.  I'm still skeptical that all these numbers are just going to distract us from more critical analysis of how films work on our brains.  Apparatus theory is out of fashion, but still for my money the most critical approach.","03/02/10 15:42:43",0,"70.19.230.199"

But this is the new battlefield of a culture war, and there's nothing good about that. The problem isn't that some social media agent is sharing details of your blatant abuse of a sick day... the problem is that many of us, honest or not, feel the need to use sick days for personal uses. There is a deeper problem in that which transcends the media used to traffic information... it is a problem of broken and toxic relationships. In the sick day example, it's the problem of a dishonest (and, most likely, justifiably miserable) employee giving ""cause"" to a predatory employer.  We all screw up at times, but is a fudged sick day a firing offense (when the average cost of new recruiting for a corporate office position is $20,000 or more)? In these times, yes, because employers (private and public), generally speaking, have an agenda to reduce headcount (THIS ECONOMY!) and are looking for any reason to do so. And when you terminate someone nowadays, you are depriving them of vital care and nourishment because they likely cannot get another job above the poverty line easily. Same thing with the whole health insurance debacle... the problem is a regulatory system that, currently, allows insurers to both disqualify reimbursements for ""preexisting conditions"" or allows insurers, sometimes in weaselly ways, to kick these people off their rolls altogether. (And in some cases, deny these people reasonable opportunities to work in an insurance-benefit position in the first place) <br />
<br />
If Twitter/Google are the media over which some of these business or social transactions take place, are Twitter/Google abusing the audience? Not necessarily. Twitter is fairly neutral infrastructure, and Google seems to have an intent of social responsibility. <br />
<br />
But Facebook revels in it. Zuckerberg is not a protective shepherd of his flock... he's the wolf. Where other services have been neutral or protective of privacy concerns (you have to deliberately open your privacy settings to be fully ""public""), Facebook is, by default, very wide open and very encouraging of risky behavior. This is because Facebook, like Internet companies of two decades ago, doesn't thrive on it's present relationship with customers and users; it thrives on a perception of endless growth and steeply-upward utilization curves. The more, the better. And to get there, Facebook is openly and actively encouraging its users to share EVERYTHING, with few controls or warnings about harm prevention. Even putting aside the above examples of lives ruined... I'm sure many well-intending people have needlessly lost respect and eroded friendships over some FarmVille or Birthday Quiz!-type viral app bullshit that returns zero value. Facebook wants you to engage fully in all of it, consequences be damned. And for that, regarding the 99% of the audience that doesn't have an expert background in information management, Facebook is a predator.<br />
<br />
As such, because we have fucked-up employers, a fucked-up healthcare system, and a bunch of fucked-up Internet companies conspiring to waste our time if not sell our valuable secrets... the world is imperfect. And going back to that first paragraph ""Ideally"", our concepts of ubiquitous communication in an ideal world do not apply. The media has to fit the world it exists in. If not, disorder and chaos are the consequences. Disruptive change might be more apt in, say, Iran, but here in the US we have a good enough thing going such that we don't want a bunch of academics and entrepreneurs pushing us into the abyss for the sake of intellectual validation... or a quick buck.","03/05/10 10:03:13",0,"12.236.224.105"

<br />
What are the LT effects of living a public online life? Can we break out of our roles and seek fresh starts and a new direction if detailed descriptions of our lives (including all our gaffes, big and small) are etched into the fabric of the Web since we were a child?  <br />
<br />
I think based on the phone book and google name searching examples you mentioned adm, we'll inevitably find a new center of gravity in our online presence that matches who we are now. I sense we'll, in a general sense, seek out those connections based on immediate relevancy more than ever. While information is more available, it is also more relevant, with less relevant or past details fading more and more quickly into the background.<br />
<br />
However, we're in a 'awkward' phase of devt during which institutions, our values, our in-person connections, and our emerging trends are simply not in sync. These media trends AREN'T our entire world, just a subset of it, like what you said BrianVan. Our social structures (education, healthcare, law, politics, employment, security) are simply not in line with real-time relevancy of information in mind, nor are their agendas concerned with our best interest.  These institutions can, will, and DO discriminate against us based on ALL of what they see, relevant or irrelevant. The message to throw caution to the wind based completely on the ideal of ubiquity is dangerous, similar to what you said BrianVan, to the degree we're beholden to these social structures.<br />
<br />
In the far future (ie. 30 years or so), I can imagine our human-ness and corresponding details of our lives will become practically irrelevant, as we evolve out of our humanity and mesh into technology (a la Singularity - thx adm for your links awhile ago!)..but until then, there's a lot to watch for.<br />

I guess what I'm thinking is that while the Simpsons, Family Guy and 30 Rock use all that winking irony to return to stable or familiar ideals: the family in the animated shows and the pursuit of success or love in 30 Rock.<br />
<br />
Community does the whole self-reflexive thing too, but not in the service of returning to what we know; instead, it's about finding a non-traditional family and making do at a community college. So instead of upending 'master narratives' by playing with them, it actually suggests new narratives - which is what I think the thing after postmodernism has to do. In a sense, art/entertainment have to return to being sincere without being naive -i.e. have to actually state a belief in something without trotting out hoary cliches about 'fundamental truths' or whatever.<br />

It is a function of two things: fear of embarrassment, and also fear of causing discomfort (such as embarrassment) to others. I think it is quite possible to overcome one's own fear of embarrassment without compromising anything which might be said to be a fundamental part of what makes one oneself (although to be frank I think such a compromise is desirable in the long run and notions of owing anything to a particular disposition per se are sentimental, illogical and worthless - shyness causes quite a lot of dissatisfaction, no matter how at ease people force themselves to believe they are with being shy to avoid having to face up to tackling it, and I therefore I urge shy people to tackle it if they can). Anyway, overcoming one's own fear of embarrassment puts one in a better position to avoid making other people feel awkward (for example, by appearing aloof, or making people feel self-conscious), but allows one to maintain the sensitivity to the feelings of others which gives rise to this component of shyness, I think. That sensitivity, rather than fear of being embarrassed oneself, is the worthwhile part of a shy person, I think. The excessive fear for one's own dignity is, in my view, rather crippling, especially when combined with a wish to avoid causing discomfort or imposition or embarrassment to others (particularly if other people are embarrassed by the presence of someone who feels awkward socially).","04/06/10 19:40:38",0,"80.41.29.18"

27836,6972,"that article","http://","well, first off: the whole economics must describe the whole world premise is a little iffy. behavioral economic is so faddish right now because regular economics does such a crappy job at predicting human behavior (as opposed analyzing present/past financial data)...<br />
<br />
second: my own pet peeve - the golden mean fallacy. the author says is the proponents fault, but that it must also be the catholics' fault too. that's a heavy charge for two sentences worth of description. this sort of thing is all over the paper.<br />
<br />
third: she defines nothing. what is ""sexist?"" the choices people have or the impact those choices have upon everyone at once? does one outweigh the other? for the author, there's no intrinsic value in having a choice so all females are doomed by that choice's impact.<br />
<br />
fourth: there's a whole bunch of super conservative folks who don't have sex before marriage. not saying that's right or wrong, but that sort of self-selection removes a whole bunch of guys and girls from the ""market"" who don't want to be on birth control. that's likely a pretty large contingent of people who would otherwise be harmed by the prisoner's dilemma.<br />
<br />
fifth: men face no pressure to have kids, settle down, etc? besides the recent scientific data that says men are just as likely to have unhealthy babies as they age, i'm not sure it's a safe assumption to think of guys as these freewheelin' dudes who would bang regularly forever. there's also societal pressure on guys is what i'm saying. and really, there is ""no"" social stigma with divorce anymore? c'mon.<br />
<br />
six: she assumes pregnant ladies can't have sex for some reason.<br />
<br />
seven: ""That is, the principle of comparative advantage no longer applies, or at least does not apply with the same force as in the past. This, in turn, means that men and women become, quite simply, less interesting to one another. Sameness begets ennui, which begets divorce."" this is pretty disgusting stuff. equality leads to boredom leads to divorce. makes sense to me.... especially because ""Sandra Tsing Loh"" said it was true for some atlantic article.<br />
<br />
eight: ""And it is the woman, not the man, who bears the emotional costs of postabortion guilt and trauma."" jesus. ignoring the rightness or wrongness of abortion or contraception (which in my mind are far different), the guilt/trauma thing is a red herring and a huge distraction and is not at all proven by scientific literature. see the reaction to sc justice kennedy's trauma reasoning in the late term abortion case ... there's a lot of not happy people.<br />
<br />
nine: ""On net, women and children are the big losers in the contraceptive society."" why is there no mention of the formerly absent fathers, now willing to care for children? or the formerly destitute children, now able to be supported? <br />
<br />
ten: lots of this seems really irrelevant because there's contraception other than birth control??<br />
<br />
but like you said, the whole incentives calculation seems a little robotic. if i am going to cheat on my gf, i won't flirt w/ the girl at work thinking ""ah yes, i will bang this girl because it will go undetected!"" this seems to be lacking in the spontaneity of such a thing, and not addressing any of my issues that led to it happening. in the world of economics, incentives drive everything -- but human behavior is too complex for this sorta thing.<br />

 I went and saw him during his book tour in New York and listened to his sarcastic responses to some pretty lame questions on the fourth floor of the sweltering Barnes and Noble @ Union Square. What can I say but that there sat the most VAPID man I have seen. Disappointed is not the word I felt. Sadness more than anything. Bedrooms is stale and revisits characters, Some of which I cannot believe are still alive. Especially Julian.  And only 190 pages. Was cranking such a quick Novella more of an obligation than the passion with which he seemed to write Less Than Zero!? Or even Glamorama? Imperial Bedrooms IS FLAT AND DULL.  And after seeing him in person and meeting him, he is most definitely a man obsessed with his own elegance or imagined elegance.  Bedrooms is lacking more than just force. It's an empty excuse for a sequel. Much like the online definition of VAPID which is below. This book and Mr. Ellis are both.<br />
 Go to the library and check it out if your curiosity is that great. But frankly watch a few episodes of TMZ and you will already know what these characters grew up into.<br />

The longest essay in David Foster Wallace's Consider the Lobster (126 pages, if I recall correctly) was a ""review"" of a usage dictionary of the English language that spent a numbing amount of time discussing descriptive vs. prescriptive grammar. So this guy is clearly right from a prescriptive perspective -- ""login"" not only isn't a word, but it doesn't add anything useful to the language. From a descriptive perspective, we might note that in the second person present tense, it doesn't present any particular problems. <br />
<br />
I could get into a whole discussion about what would happen if we ""allow"" the usage for the present tense, in keeping with the descriptive perspective. It'd make our ""grammar rules"" that much more complicated. But who, honestly, learns to write correctly by memorizing rules? Nobody, right? You just pick it up. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, what we're arguing about here is the space between ""log"" and ""in,"" in a certain limited number of cases. I dunno, I feel like what this guy owes me, more so than a proof of why ""login"" is a noun and not a verb, is some evidence that the word is in common use as a verb outside a very limited and technical body of writing.

""Do New Yorkers really want that much choice and customization?"" I know the obvious answer is ""We think so. We hope so. We'll see,"" but I'm interested in what thoughts you and the team have had on the possibility of ingredient proliferation and option paralysis as flow disruptors on either side of the counter.<br />
<br />
I've been attracted to this concept specifically because of all of the possible taste combinations, but that has also been the thing I've been wondering about as a potential complication. I hadn't even thought of physical bottlenecks at the counter as the article mentioned, but had thought about option paralysis in general. Seems like it could take people quite a while to decide what they want, which one would think could be a snag in a quick-service setting. <br />
<br />
And on the flipside I was wondering about the practicality of sourcing, prepping, and keeping ready so many different things at once behind the counter in a quick-service setting. The patties are one thing, but so many of the scoops I've read about are cooked items with enough ingredients to require a hell of a lot of ongoing prep in order for them to always be ready when the customer orders. I'm sure you all have it figured out but I'd love to know more about how that can be done in a practical and affordable way in terms of staffing and process. Or maybe less how-to than why-it's-not-a-problem.<br />
<br />
Do you guys plan to let options live or die based on popularity? One article I read said you all wanted only more and more options in the future - like 100 scoops. But do you plan to let, say, lamb patties or compressed rice buns or jerk sauce die if they don't keep pace with the others, or is that variety intended to be permanently built in as a defining feature?<br />
<br />
I can't help contrasting this concept to Chipotle, where the beauty and ease are in the simplicity of the choice sequence, where each of the three or four steps has no more than 3 or 4 options. That one screams move-em-through whereas this one seems to lean more towards stop-n-gape. I can see all the thought that has gone into this concept from multiple discliplines, though, so I'm sure you guys have already addressed this issue and have some good responses.<br />
<br />
Also am I dreaming this or could one formerly build a burger on the 4food site? I could swear I did that once months ago but I can't find that option on the site now and was wondering if that indicated any recent reconsideration of the ingredients options.<br />

And some day, that Starbucks lady who screamed at the barista that she wouldn't call a 'medium' a 'tall' might get into my old cab, and she'll have the benefit of being taken where she asks to go.

<br />
Formspring has big numbers but they're the type of numbers that mask high churn. I don't know a single person who's used it lately; I know many people who stopped using it after picking it up for two weeks. It's not spreading outside of a niche group of people who spend tons of time online engaging in cutting edge interactive products.<br />
<br />
As for Quora, in the last month I've seen a substantial rise in mentions and links into the site. Again, this interest comes almost entirely from people belonging to the same work/social circles as the Formspring users. I could be underestimating interest by two orders of magnitude here (after all, I do know they have more than 20 active users) and we're still not talking about numbers that suggest more than a transient appeal to a niche audience - yet. (It does not help that the niche audience tends to use new toys transiently.)<br />
<br />
I'm not insistent on pessimism/cynicism; I'm just playing the role of the oddsmaker. The odds are that we won't be talking about Quora as the next Twitter in six months. It needs to evolve past its current status as a social media / Silicon Valley circle jerk before it can be viewed as something with wider cultural acceptance.<br />
<br />
BTW, plenty of great business models out there that only serve Silicon Valley circle jerking! They could be profitable with a small audience. That would be better than having no business model and growing faster than your servers can handle, like some outfits we know.","01/05/11 17:56:19",0,"69.193.179.52"

<br />
- My anecdotal story is not proof of a widespread phenomenon<br />
<br />
- Twitter may actually be ahead of its time. It's optimized for use on  mobile phones without advanced smartphone features. But it's also very usable on modern smartphone devices (moreso for feed browsing), and now those devices have huge market penetration. These devices are much closer to their users than the usual MSM channels could ever get. You carry it in your pocket all day... there's a much better chance you'd see breaking news on your smartphone than you'd run into a TV playing a cable news channel. (It also helps that Twitter now consistently ""breaks"" news faster than MSM by a few minutes) This is correlated to the general trend that smartphone applications are really taking off... because they're so CLOSE to the user. A dinky iPhone app nowadays seems like an idea with a lot more traction than a GREAT desktop app... even though great desktop apps deliver way more value to the user than slapdash mobile apps.","01/09/11 13:53:33",0,"66.65.168.207"

Then I saw a RT (re-Tweet) of someone saying Fox News was covering the story and CNN was not. #CNNFail  That's when I got up and went to the television. I kept up with Twitter on my blackberry and it continued to be the source of the most news and often before I heard reports on television. Afterall, with TV you can only watch one channel at a time. A person can only say one thing at a time. On Twitter it's a tidal wave. <br />
<br />
Another thing that was important to me was to see what my community had to say about the story and to be able to be ""together"" as the horrible news unfolded. It was powerful watching as the feed started with only a few tweets on the topic, then everyone talking about it and then people getting back to their normal conversation over the course of the following few hours. <br />

<br />
from Glenn Reynolds ""To be clear, if youre using this event to criticize the rhetoric of Mrs. Palin or others with whom you disagree, then youre either: (a) asserting a connection between the rhetoric and the shooting, which based on evidence to date would be what we call a vicious lie; or (b) youre not, in which case youre just seizing on a tragedy to try to score unrelated political points, which is contemptible. Which is it?<br />
<br />
I understand the desperation that Democrats must feel after taking a historic beating in the midterm elections and seeing the popularity of ObamaCare plummet while voters flee the party in droves. But those who purport to care about the health of our political community demonstrate precious little actual concern for Americas political well-being when they seize on any pretext, however flimsy, to call their political opponents accomplices to murder.<br />

Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite. ","02/02/11 13:58:15",0,"72.43.163.234"

Everything from Tumblr to Facebook Comments to Twitter to the 'like' button to Gawker Media to 4chan have resulted in a gradual erosion of what blogging seemed like it would be. And thats okay! But 'reblogging' and 'liking' and 'approaching television' and 'finding private networks' and& and so many other things& blogging probably does need some other kind of new stupid name.

<br />
It may be a stretch comparing some traditional marketing methods with gamification of digital media, but if we consider the biker at the rally or the metalhead at the concert, they are both measuring their progress in those communities by patches that attest to their participation it that societal circle: they are playing that role and they have the badges to prove it.  <br />
<br />
Also, the child who ""collects them all"" is playing for the complete set of toys, but the non-game activity is the ""chore"" of getting to the bottom of the box in the course of X breakfasts (where X = 1 if you cheat!)  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I consider the ""engagement"" akin to the loyalty to a particular community or brand, which is a similar fight for relevance with various online service offerings, be they a weight loss site like ""LoseIt"" or ""FitBit"" or a finances planning site like ""Mint"" -- these examples use badges and points as a way to present progress toward goals.<br />
<br />
However, I do agree that a lot of gamification is useless crap: were a retailer to employ this strategy to promote my purchases, I'd say ""no thanks"" and opt out if at all possible.<br />
<br />
Obviously this stuff is immature, but I was attempting to find antecedents in near-virtual property in a pre-digital economy.  Maybe all of this stuff is the ""wooden nickels"" of our age?","02/14/12 14:59:02",0,"66.187.202.131"

There are probably some connections to be drawn between this situation, the hand-wringing over similar ""truths"" in ""The Social Network,"" Mike Daisey, and some other postmodern non-fiction writers (like <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/magazine/the-fact-checker-versus-the-fabulist.html?ref=review"">John D'Agata</a>) who are trying to capture (or claiming to capture) the essential truths of a situation.<br />
<br />
It seems that the audience of media insiders for this show, as you point out, can't separate themselves enough to look at it as a story, and can mostly only evaluate its verisimilitude. Hence, the crappy reviews. <br />
<br />
My feeling is that when something is presented as non-fiction, it has an obligation to adhere to the reality of what happened. When something is presented as a fiction -- like, I would argue, The Newsroom is -- then there is no such obligation, and the question becomes whether the story is told well or not. (In The Newsroom, the ""punjab"" comment and the drunk boss seem so unbelievable [to me, at least] that they decrease my enjoyment of the story.*) In The Newsroom and his other works, Sorkin does a nice job of elevating the audience's anxiety by walking the thin line between fiction and non-fiction. For me, the problem is less that his shows get some details of reality wrong and more that he often he gets hung up on the grandiosity of his ideas (e.g., Studio 60's notorious ""This show is important!"" sensibility), and the quality of his work suffers for it. <br />
